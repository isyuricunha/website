When creating an issue, please include a clear and descriptive title, along with relevant details about the problem or suggestion.

## Pull Requests

We welcome contributions through pull requests! If you're working on a bug fix, new feature, or improvements, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name.
3. Make your changes and commit following the [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits) guidelines.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
6. Make sure you run `pnpm check` before submitting your pull request to ensure there are no issues.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
cd honghong.me
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:

   Most features are turned off by default, so you don't need to set up all the environment variables to run the app. However, if you want to use a specific feature, you can set the necessary environment variables in the `.env.local` file and set the [flags](#flags) to true.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Fill in the Better Auth secret:

```properties
# https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=""
```

5. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

6. Run PostgreSQL using Docker (or your preferred method):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

7. Run the database migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

8. Seed the database:

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

9. Run the app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev # Run all services (may take more resources to run)
# or
pnpm dev:web # Run only the web app
# or
pnpm dev:docs # Run only the documentation app
```

The services will be available at the following URLs:

| Service                 | URL              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| App                     | `localhost:3000` |
| React Email             | `localhost:3001` |
| Docs                    | `localhost:3002` |
| ESLint Config Inspector | `localhost:7777` |
| Database                | `localhost:5432` |
| Redis                   | `localhost:6379` |
