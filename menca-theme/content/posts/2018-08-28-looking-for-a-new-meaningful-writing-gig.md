At the beginning of August, I said farewell to the company where I've been contracting for the past two years. I worked with a great team, but I'd gotten burned out and it was time to take a break and then look at what I want to do next.

My plan had been to focus on publishing and doing my own writing full-time whenever I left that contract gig, but... I haven't built up the publishing to the point where it can pay all the bills yet, and frankly, it feels a little frivolous to me at this moment in time.

Given everything going on in the world... I want to do something a bit more meaningful. I want to use my writing skill-set to do something with more impact.

I stumbled across the [high-impact job board at 80,000 hours][1]; they say:

> They’re all high-impact opportunities at top organisations that are working on some of the [world’s most pressing problems][2].

The types of problems that these organizations work on are definitely interesting, and direly need to be addressed. Things like; positively shaping the development of artificial intelligence; biorisk reduction; promoting effective altruism; improving institutional decision-making; all these things are big-picture, high-impact problems where I'd find the work a lot more meaningful than making another rich company richer. Or maybe something with some social impact, like working on gender equality, or LGBT rights, or something along those lines.

I'm currently looking around to see what's out there. But if you're reading this, and you happen to know an organization working on a meaningful problem that could use a writer, I'd love for you to reach out. Drop me a message via [my contact form][3].

Wish me luck!
