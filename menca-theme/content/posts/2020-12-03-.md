## The Starting Point: Our First Foray into Prosumer Home Networking

When we moved to Vermont in 2017, we decided to prioritize good internet in our house, because we both worked from home. Internet is our connection to our co-workers, and our ability to do our jobs and earn our paychecks. 

We quickly found that with both of us on video calls, the 125 Mbps we were getting from Comcast just wasn't enough. It was time to upgrade our cable internet plan, and our network. Comcast suggested we upgrade to - I think double the speed? I believe it was the 300 Mbps plan.

I decided this would be a good time to get rid of Comcast's stupid Xfinity Gateway Router thing that tried to broadcast a signal that anyone could jump onto what seemed like every 5 seconds, no matter how many times we turned it off, since we were making networking changes anyway. So we bought a [a Motorola cable modem][1] that had built-in WiFi. 

Alas, the speeds we were getting from it were pretty poor, no matter how we tried to tweak it. And our ability to tweak it was somewhat limited, because it's consumer gear. We couldn't run wires through that house due to some... insulation-related considerations - so we needed better wireless performance.

We decided to take the plunge and invest in some [Ubiquiti][2] equipment. I'm just geeky enough to enjoy network admin stuff, and it's really appealing equipment for someone with a prosumer mindset. So we added these three components to our network:

  * [Ubiquiti UniFi Security Gateway][3] 
  * [Ubiquiti UniFi 8-port PoE Switch][4]
  * [Ubiquity UniFi Pro Access Point][5]

It took a little more setting up than an all-in-one consumer router/wifi access point, but pretty much immediately I was sold on it. I could control EVERYTHING at a granular level. I could SEE what all the devices were doing on the network. I could analyze radio signal strength. I was drunk with power. It was amazing.

Fast forward a couple years later to 2019, where we noticed we were getting grainy video again for our video calls, and had some general slow network issues. Speed test. Huh. It's really not very fast. And we paid all the money for better networking gear - we should probably upgrade our Comcast plan again to gigabit internet this time. 

Yay, faster internet coming into the house!

Oh. Wait. The speed tests from our wireless stuff aren't what we expect. And... even wired, we're not getting great performance. What could be the problem? 

Oh. That gear we bought in 2017? Turns out, the modem didn't support gigabit internet, and the access point was speed-constrained, too. Boo. 

So we upgraded to:

  * [This Motorola modem][6]
  * [The Ubiquiti UniFi Nano HD Wireless Access Point][7]

NOW we're cooking! Regular speeds of 500-600 Mbps at our wireless devices on the second floor. And the things that can be wired in at the entertainment system (AppleTV, PS4 Pro, Synology) are blazing fast. I think that's the best we could do since we were constrained to not run wires through the walls.

## v2: Setting up a Home Network in the New House

We moved in November, and we're now in a delightful new house. There are a couple of key differences between this house and the last one, though, that affect our home networking needs.

  1. It's bigger than the old house. Like, a lot bigger. And our entertainment system, where we've historically kept our networking equipment, is on one end of the house. Even our badass Ubiquiti UniFi AP can't reach the other end of the house.
  2. We are not constrained against running wires through the walls. And our offices are on the first floor, into a full basement with an open ceiling, where we can get fairly easy wire runs through the walls. Which means wired connections for our offices are possible!

Shortly after we moved in, I ran a wired connection to my iMac. I have ALL THE SPEEDZ now. (Around 930 Mbps.) You can't make me give it back. I will FIGHT YOU.

The other complication is that... with the UniFi Security Gateway, we don't have a hardware controller for our network. Hubby's laptop is the controller. One of hubby's laptops. A very old, 2012 MacBook Pro, which he has just replaced. I've found it more than mildly inconvenient that I can't manage the network from one of my devices (partially because of resistance to installing Java on _my_ very old 2012 MBP). 

So now that we're redoing the network, it might be nice to have a hardware controller. We've had our eyes on a UniFi Cloud Key (and then UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2, and then the [UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 Plus][8]) for a while, but hadn't ever gotten around to adding it at the old place. Seemed like a good thing to have at the new place! So we ordered it. But then we got a housewarming gift from a friend, and it was also a Cloud Key Gen 2 Plus. Haha, great minds think alike!

Except, after more discussion with said friend, we all came to the conclusion that we might actually want a [UniFi Dream Machine Pro][9]. This would replace the security gateway, _and_ it's a hardware controller, and it supports UniFi's security camera stuff, and it's future-proofing for some upcoming tech (wireless access points) that we will likely invest in because we have apparently become _THOSE_ people who routinely upgrade their networking setup.

So, for the moment, the new home networking setup will consist of:

  * [Motorola modem][6]
  * [Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine Pro][9]
  * Three different Ubiquiti UniFi wireless access points (our [AP Pro][5], our [Nano HD][7], and a borrowed [UniFi Flex HD Access Point][10]).
  * [Ubiquiti UniFi 8-port PoE switch][4] in the new networking center we're setting up in the basement
  * [TRENDnet 24-port Patch Panel][11] for the wire runs in the networking center
  * [Ubiquiti UniFi 8-port switch][12] in the home entertainment center (this one has 1 passthrough PoE port so it can power the WAP at that end of the house)
  * [Ubiquiti USW Flex Mini][13] switch that will sit on hubby's desk for all the devices he wants to wire in (personal laptop, work laptop, maybe a WAP for that end of the house)

We're moving around the equipment, too, so we're establishing a new "networking center" in the basement. That's where the UDM Pro will live, along with the PoE switch and the Synology that we use for backups. We'll do wire runs from there via the 24-port patch panel to our living room, my office, hubby's office, and the upstairs via the unfinished space over the garage and into the attic. We'll likely do a run into a closet for one of the APs, too (the Flex HD provides great coverage of the west side of the house from the closet by the front entryway).

The 24-port patch panel is a bit of overkill for what we're doing now, but I like the idea that I can grow into it as we add more wired devices. Having to buy bigger switches as we add more devices has been a bummer, so I'm putting a higher premium on room to grow.
