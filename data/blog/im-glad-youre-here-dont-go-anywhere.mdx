What's up, man?

You made it. Another day!

You should be proud of yourself. It's been a long couple months.

I know it has. It's been for me too.

I hate to be the one to tell you man, you're slipping. You're starting to fall back in that place you fought so hard to get out of.

You wanted to be here. You wanted to make it another day.

Don't slip. Don't forget, man, you're not making mistakes. You're learning.

Just trying to learn how to deal with all the things that this life throws at you.

I don't want to see you slip, man. I want you to come back. I wanna see you.

Make sure you come back.
