# What is the SQL Server Database?

The SQL Server Database is a relational database management system produced by Microsoft. It is used to store and manage large amounts of data, including structured and unstructured data. SQL Server offers a wide range of features to ensure the security, availability, and integrity of stored data, as well as to ensure system performance and scalability.<br><br>

There are several versions of SQL Server available, including SQL Server Express, SQL Server Standard, and SQL Server Enterprise. Each of these versions offers a different set of features and is suitable for different types of use.<br><br>

To work with SQL Server, it is necessary to know the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the standard language for working with relational databases and is used to create, query, and modify the data stored in the database.<br><br><br>

# Examples of SQL Queries

## Here are some examples of SQL queries that can be run on the SQL Server Database:<br><br>

### Select Query<br><br>
The following query selects all fields from the "Customers" table where the "City" field is equal to "S達o Paulo":<br>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'S達o Paulo';
```

### Insert Data
The following query inserts a new record into the "Customers" table:<br>

```sql 
INSERT INTO Customers (Name, Address, City) VALUES ('Jo達o da Silva', 'Rua das Flores, 123', 'S達o Paulo');
```
