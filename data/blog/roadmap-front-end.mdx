## Introduction

Becoming a front-end developer requires a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a lot of practice. Front-end developers design and build user interfaces for websites and applications, and must have strong attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and an eye for good design.

## Step 3: Practice and Build Projects

Now that you have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's time to put your skills to the test by building projects. Not only will this help you solidify your understanding of the technologies, but it will also give you a portfolio to showcase to potential employers.

Some project ideas to get you started:
