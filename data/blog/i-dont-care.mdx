I've always been like this. I was a shy kid with few friends. I preferred spending time alone, reading books, or playing video games.

As I got older, I realized I don't need to care about what others think. I don't have to pretend to be interested in things I'm not. I can just be myself.

I'm not saying I'm completely indifferent to everyone. I have a few close friends and family members I deeply care about. But for the most part, I just don't care.

I don't care about what people wear or what they do with their lives. I don't care about the latest news or gossip. I don't care about what's going on in the world.

Some people find my indifference off-putting, thinking I'm rude or arrogant. But I'm not. I'm just being honest.

I won't pretend to care about something I don't. I won't waste my time and energy on things that don't matter to me.

**Benefits of Indifference**

Indifference has freed me from the expectations of others. I don't have to worry about what they think or want me to be. I can just be myself.

It lets me focus on what's important to me. I don't waste time and energy on what doesn't matter. I focus on my passions and my relationships with people I care about.

It's made me more resilient. I'm not easily bothered by setbacks or disappointments. I know life has ups and downs, and I don't let the downs get me down.

**Dealing with People Who Don't Understand**

Some people find my indifference off-putting, thinking I'm rude or arrogant. But I'm not. I'm just being honest.

I try to be patient and understanding with those who don't get it. I explain I care about them but not most things. I respect their opinions, even if I disagree.

If someone's rude or disrespectful because of my indifference, I walk away. I don't have time for negative, judgmental people.

**How to Be Indifferent**

If you want to be more indifferent, here are some tips:

- **Identify what you care about.** Focus on what's truly important to you, and let go of the rest.
- **Don't compare yourself to others.** Everyone is different, with unique goals and values.
- **Accept that you can't control everything.** Focus on what's within your control.
- **Let go of expectations.** Expectations lead to disappointment.
- **Practice mindfulness.** Stay in the present without judgment.

Additional tips:

- **Don't take things personally.** Most people aren't trying to hurt you.
- **Don't dwell on the past.** It's over, and you can't change it.
- **Don't worry about the future.** Focus on the present and live in the now.

Remember, indifference doesn't mean apathy. You can be indifferent to some things and passionate about others. It's challenging but worthwhile in the long run, leading to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.

**Advice to Others**

If you struggle with indifference:

- It's okay not to care about everything.
- Focus on what matters to you.
- Don't let others' opinions bother you.
- Be yourself, not who others want you to be.
- Don't waste time and energy on what doesn't matter.
