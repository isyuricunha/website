It's... It's been a month since I left social media.

I said in the previous post that I was going to delete my social media, but then I did something better: I activated my AIs, my bots, and left my posts automatic, so sometimes I post something through my private bot on Telegram. It formats and adds things using the Tailwind standard.

My bot sees some posts, likes others, and does what I work that I don't feel like doing: looking at what others are doing.

Now, how do I feel outside of social media? Well, I feel very good.

I thought I would go through a social media detox, but it seems unnecessary. I don't open Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat to see if someone sent me something, let alone check if someone has posted something new from time to time, whether it's someone I'm following or someone I like to see (like Yetz).

Personally, I'm much better than I was.

My solitude and mindfulness are better than ever. My cell phone usage has decreased from 1 hour 30/2 hours to 25/30 minutes. And that was really good. Wow.

The only thing I need to do today is listen to music on my headphones or respond to messages from my friends (who are few), and sometimes take a look at Tinder to see what's happening.

The only exclusion I make from my cell phone usage meter is my Kindle because personally, I don't see the need to have a Kindle eBook just for that, and when I'm out, if I'm not reading a physical book or an eBook on my cell phone, I'm with my PSP (PlayStation Portable) playing, especially if it's a long trip, or I don't feel like reading.

But, changing the subject a bit from what I'm talking about right now, but still keeping the initial topic, I'm much happier and more at peace with myself.

My friends used to say I was a "weird nerd," but not in the derogatory sense, but because I have a mean-looking face, always look pissed off, and seem to be a man of few words, but in reality, I'm just a nerd who likes manga, books, anime, and technology a lot. And to top it off, I'm low-profile, meaning I hardly post anything on the internet (my bot does the posting), nor do I see the things I'm tagged/mentioned in, and there are quite a few.

I already was a fan of my solitude, only posting things that had already happened in my life, for example, many posts were recycled, and my AI-powered bot learned that I did this, so it replicates it, which makes some people think that I'm enjoying, hanging out with friends, and various other things, when in fact, I'm reading a book, maybe on a call with my friends on Discord, playing something on the computer, my PlayStation, or my PSP.

Every day I go for my morning walk/run, do my work chores, read something, and currently, I'm reading "The Knight of the Three Kingdoms" - a book by George R.R. Martin that takes place in the same world as "A Song of Ice and Fire" (from the Game of Thrones series), but the story of this book comes before that time. Or, I'm wandering around my city, taking a walk or a light run of 10/15 km.

During one of these random walks, I met one or two people who were sad, and I made them smile, but the point is, I usually make people think a lot about life.

Just this week, I met a girl walking, and I was walking in the same direction, but I was walking faster than her, and when I stopped at the pedestrian crossing, I noticed with peripheral vision that she was looking at me, so I looked at her, smiled, and she smiled back, so I took out my earphones and said, "every day I like to make someone smile, after all, a day without smiles is a wasted day," she laughed and said that day wasn't a wasted one. I lovingly laughed at that sentence and told her to take care, put my earphones back in, and continued walking... On the way, I met a Saint Bernard dog (the same name as my city), and I always found this breed wonderful, so I had to stop to pet the dog, then I thanked the dog's owner for letting me pet the dog and went on my way. After that, I arrived at the Green Area square (the people of my city gave this nickname to the square, but it has another name). I bought an acai bowl, sat on an isolated wooden bench, and listened to some Post Malone songs while watching people walking, running, or exercising, and I said to myself, "if I were spending my time on social media, I couldn't have smiled as much as I did today."

Ah, every day has been wonderful and unique, even though I do repetitive things, these things end up becoming unique because of something that happens while I'm doing that task.

I believe the craziest part of this is that I'm doing various things without losing my solitude. I never sought validation on social media, just as I never cared if people stopped talking to me. Seriously, I'm the kind of guy most girls would get mad at because if I message you and you deliberately ignore me, I don't care. If I message you and you don't reply for days, I won't send another message demanding attention, time, or a response. I always reply when I pick up my phone, meaning if you take a minute or ten days to reply, when I pick up my phone or open Telegram or WhatsApp on the computer, I'll reply to you.

Many people think that my way is because I don't care, but it's not quite like that. Despite loving my solitude, if I have a relationship with you, friendly or romantic, and you take a while to show up, I'll call to see if you're okay, and if you don't respond, I'll send an SMS or a message via some app. The problem is, for you to become my friend, it takes time, but when that happens, you become part of my lived routine.

There's a big difference between when you're just someone who talks to me and when you become at least someone with a relationship I consider a friendship. And probably the biggest one is that I'll show and tell much more than if you weren't.

Now, speaking of this blog, it's my day-to-day or what I like to talk about the most, it's my sporadic, because I post here when I believe there will be a post, and it's not linear, quite the opposite.

Well, today I'm going to end this post here.

Always remember that you can send me an email or call me on Telegram.

Take care.
