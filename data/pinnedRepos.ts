    longDescription: `I built the first version of this website during the latter half of quarantine to rate movies that my friends and I had watched over discord. Then decided it needed a remodel, and created ScuffedMDB (Movie-rating V2.0), made with NextJS and ChakraUI. It has been great to make a website, that not only all my friends can use, but other people can use (and have :)) for their own movie rating sites.`,
