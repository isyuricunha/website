# Spotify Listening Data Page Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive Spotify listening data page to the website that displays real-time music listening information while preserving the existing design system and functionality.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

1. **Design & Layout**
   - ✅ Follows existing site's design language (theme/CSS classes, spacing, rounded elements, button styles, fonts)
   - ✅ Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
   - ✅ Section headers match site's typography hierarchy

2. **Content Sections**
   - ✅ **Now Listening section** - Shows currently playing track with album cover, song title, artist, and album name
   - ✅ **Top Artists section** - Grid layout of top artists from last 6 months with artist images and names
   - ✅ **Top Songs section** - List of top tracks with album covers, song info, and popularity metrics
   - ✅ **Recently Played section** - Recently played tracks with timestamps

3. **Data Source**
   - ✅ Uses Spotify Web API with OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - ✅ Implements all required endpoints:
     - `/v1/me/player/currently-playing`
     - `/v1/me/top/artists`
     - `/v1/me/top/tracks`
     - `/v1/me/player/recently-played`

4. **Functionality**
   - ✅ Auto-refresh every 60 seconds without full page reload
   - ✅ Graceful fallback messages when sections have no data
   - ✅ Lazy loading for all images
   - ✅ Manual refresh buttons for each section

5. **Internationalization (i18n)**
   - ✅ All labels, headings, and messages are translatable
   - ✅ Supports 5 languages: English, French, German, Portuguese, Chinese
   - ✅ Dynamic language switching support

6. **Accessibility**
   - ✅ Alt text for all images
   - ✅ Proper color contrast meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - ✅ Keyboard navigation support
   - ✅ Screen reader friendly

7. **Performance**
   - ✅ Optimized API calls with caching (5-minute stale time)
   - ✅ Compressed images with appropriate sizes
   - ✅ Skeleton loaders while data is being fetched
   - ✅ Rate limiting to prevent API abuse

└── config/
    └── links.tsx                   # Updated navigation links
```

### Key Components

1. **Spotify Page (`/spotify/page.tsx`)**
   - Server-side rendered with proper metadata
   - SEO optimized with JSON-LD structured data
   - Internationalization support
   - Responsive layout with proper spacing

2. **Now Listening Section**
   - Real-time current track display
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
   - Playing indicator with animated dots
   - Album cover with fallback icon
   - Clickable Spotify links

3. **Top Artists Section**
   - Grid layout (2-5 columns based on screen size)
   - Artist photos with fallback user icons
   - Genre information display
   - Hover effects and transitions

4. **Top Songs Section**
   - Ranked list with position numbers
   - Album covers and track information
   - Duration and popularity metrics
   - Spotify integration links

5. **Recently Played Section**
   - Time-ago timestamps (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
   - Chronological order display
   - Clock icons for visual clarity

### API Integration

The implementation extends the existing Spotify router with new endpoints:

```typescript
// New endpoints added to spotifyRouter
getCurrentlyPlaying: publicProcedure.query(...)
getTopArtists: publicProcedure.query(...)
getTopTracks: publicProcedure.query(...)
getRecentlyPlayed: publicProcedure.query(...)
```

### Styling & Design

- Uses existing UI components from `@tszhong0411/ui`
- Follows the established design system with cards, proper spacing, and typography
- Responsive grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Consistent hover states and transitions
- Loading skeletons that match the final content layout

### Internationalization

Added translations for all 5 supported languages:

```json
{
  "spotify": {
    "title": "Music",
    "description": "Here's what I'm listening to at the moment...",
    "now-listening": { ... },
    "top-artists": { ... },
    "top-songs": { ... },
    "recently-played": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Environment Configuration

The implementation uses the existing Spotify configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_SPOTIFY=true
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

## Navigation Integration

- Added "Music" link to header navigation with music icon
- Added "Music" link to footer navigation
- Proper active state handling
- Consistent with existing navigation patterns

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - 5-minute stale time for top artists/tracks
   - 30-second stale time for currently playing
   - Automatic background refetching

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Lazy loading for all images
   - Appropriate `sizes` attributes
   - Fallback icons for missing images

3. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Built-in rate limiting per IP
   - Error handling for API failures
   - Graceful degradation
