## philosophy

all these projects share common themes:

- **privacy-first** - your data belongs to you
- **lightweight** - fast and efficient, no bloat
- **open source** - transparent and auditable
- **practical** - built to solve real problems
- **documented** - clear documentation and examples

i believe in building tools that respect users' privacy, work offline, and don't depend on cloud services unless absolutely necessary.

## what's next

- studying for postgresql dba certifications
- maintaining my homelab infrastructure
- working on my health and running goals
