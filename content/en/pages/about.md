## WHO AM I

I am Yuri Cunha, a Brazilian tech guy who likes databases, Linux, homelabs and breaking things in a controlled way so I can learn how to fix them.

Right now I am building my path as a PostgreSQL and MongoDB focused DBA, while also playing the roles of sysadmin, homelab owner and eternal student of how computers actually work.

Yes, this site is part of that mess.

## What I do in tech

On paper, I am a Database Technology student and an aspiring DBA. In practice, my day to day usually includes some mix of:

- taking care of Linux servers
- playing with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- setting up Docker Compose stacks
- breaking and recovering databases on purpose to practice
- tuning queries and configs to squeeze a bit more performance
- documenting everything so I do not forget later

I like the full path of a service: from the machine and the network, to the database and the application, to the monitoring and backup.

## Homelab

I run a small but very real homelab. Some highlights:

- multiple servers at home running Ubuntu Server, Proxmox and Alpine - sometimes VM's with Windows Workstation.
- Oracle Cloud VMs for extra experiments and databases  
- everything connected with Tailscale so I can reach my stuff from anywhere  
- domain `yuricunha.com` with services on subdomains  
- access exposed with Cloudflare tunnels instead of opening ports directly

Typical self hosted services that pass through my lab at some point:

- Nextcloud for files
- Joplin Server for notes
- PrivateBin for quick paste sharing
- Databases like PostgreSQL and friends
- Local LLMs with Ollama/Llama.cpp for experiments

If it runs on Linux and is useful for infra, monitoring, backup or learning, there is a good chance I will test it here.

## Projects and experiments

I like to keep my learning visible and repeatable, so I create labs and small projects. Examples:

- a PostgreSQL DBA lab and portfolio with real cases  
- experiments with high availability, backups and monitoring  
- scripts and runbooks to automate boring tasks  
- Android app experiments like a personal music client  
- small brands and ideas like personal tooling names and logos

The idea is simple: have concrete things I can point to when I say I know how to do something.

## Study path

I am formally studying Database Technology and using this site to complement the academic part with:

- practical labs with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Linux, networking and infra practice
- notes about performance tuning, backups and monitoring
- summaries of courses, certifications and books

I like to mix theory and practice. I do not fully trust something until I break it with my own hands and see how it fails.

## Systems and tools I like

A few things you will see a lot around here:

- Linux in general, especially Ubuntu Server on my machines  
- testing Arch based distros on my laptop like EndeavourOS, CachyOS and Garuda  
- window managers and Wayland compositors for fun and pain  
- Docker Compose for most services  
- PostgreSQL as my main database  
- Python and shell for scripting

I enjoy tweaking performance, trying different kernels and seeing how far I can push my hardware without making it unusable.

## Health and running

Outside pure tech I am also on a long term project to be lighter and run better.

Things I track and care about:

- weight, calories and macros with food scale and apps  
- running training plans using Garmin Coach  
- building up to 5K and beyond with a mix of run and walk  
- trying to be consistent instead of perfect

So yes, in the same place you might see posts about `pg_dump`, you may also see notes about running sessions and diet.

## How I see this site

This site is not meant to be a super polished portfolio only. It is more like:

- a notebook for my labs and experiments  
- a log of what I am learning  
- a place to centralize docs I would write anyway  
- a way to show a realistic picture of what I know and what I am still figuring out

If something here looks useful to you, great. If it looks chaotic, that is also honest.

## Values and style

A few things about how I think and work:

- I like clear, direct communication  
- I prefer transparency over marketing talk  
- I enjoy structure and documentation, even for small things  
- I tend to be conservative in values and careful with shortcuts in tech

In short, I like systems that are understandable, debuggable and that I can fix at 3 am if they go down.
