## WHO AM I

I'm a Full Stack Engineer in Hong Kong. I am 18 and learning TypeScript, Next.js, React.js, Node.js, and database management. Now, I have a passion for learning UI/UX.

I started learning web development on December 5, 2020 (I was 14 years old). It's a big challenge because it's just one of my hobbies, and I have yet to take any courses. I am self-learning on YouTube. One of my favorite YouTube channels is [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja). I learned a lot of web development skills from him.

I love using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to create a website. Then use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host my codebase. After that, I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy my website.

Thanks to **Timothy Lin** for the
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It helped me when I haven't any idea how to create a blog from scratch. My code isn't like the starter code because I changed a lot of code :)
