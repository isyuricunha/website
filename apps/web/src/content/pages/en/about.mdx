## WHO AM I

Hi there! I'm Yuri, a dbA passionate about building resilient systems and ensuring seamless performance. My expertise spans server optimization, database management, and deploying scalable cloud solutions.

Currently, I'm exploring new opportunities to apply my skills in designing efficient infrastructures and optimizing IT operations. In my previous roles, I mastered fine-tuning databases and creating reliable architectures at companies like Divinobit (now Bairon).

What drives me? Solving complex challenges in infrastructure, creating streamlined processes, and transforming raw data into actionable insights. For me, it's like engineering for the digital age â€” crafting solutions that stand the test of time.

While based in Brazil, I often find inspiration in solo travel, discovering diverse landscapes, and immersing myself in new cultures. These adventures keep me refreshed and ready to tackle the next big project.

Whether it's managing servers, fine-tuning databases, or scaling cloud platforms, I'm all about delivering excellence and finding harmony in technology. Let's build something remarkable together!

Thanks to **Timothy Lin** for the
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It helped me when I haven't any idea how to create a blog from scratch. My code isn't like the starter code because I changed a lot of code :)
