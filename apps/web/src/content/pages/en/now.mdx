## What I'm doing now

This page is a snapshot of what I'm focusing on right now.

### Work

- Maintaining and improving database and server infrastructure
- Working on reliability, performance, and observability

### Projects

- **[YuMusic](https://github.com/isyuricunha/yumusic)** — An open-source, lightweight Subsonic music client built natively for Android. Focused on a clean listening experience, with features like library browsing/search, playlist management, gapless playback, Android Auto, and optional integrations (e.g., scrobbling). Offline mode is under active development.
- **[Yuflow](https://github.com/isyuricunha/yuflow)** — A privacy-first task manager where your data stays on your device. Built for desktop (Tauri) and the web (PWA), with fast local search, tags/filters, offline-first behavior, and an accessible, minimalist UI.
- **[YuPomo](https://github.com/isyuricunha/YuPomo)** — A beautiful, minimalist Pomodoro timer available as a web app and a native desktop app (Tauri). Customizable cycles, local persistence, productivity statistics, notifications, and multi-language support.
- **[SQL Query Analyzer](https://github.com/isyuricunha/sql-query-analyzer)** — A web-based tool that analyzes SQL queries, highlights common performance pitfalls, and suggests optimizations (and general best practices) for DBAs, developers, and analysts who care about writing efficient SQL.
- **[website](https://github.com/isyuricunha/website)** — The source code of my personal website (yuricunha.com), built as a monorepo. It includes the Next.js web app, shared packages (UI, i18n, emails, utils), and backend pieces like tRPC and Drizzle/Postgres.

### Learning
