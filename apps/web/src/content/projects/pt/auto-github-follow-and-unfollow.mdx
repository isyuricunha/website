## About the Project

The **Auto GitHub Follow and Unfollow** is a lightweight userscript designed to simplify managing your GitHub connections. Whether you're looking to grow your network or clean up your following list, this script automates the process of following and unfollowing users directly from GitHub profiles or followers/following pages.

### What It Does

- **Automates Following**: Quickly follow multiple users without manually clicking through each profile.
- **Streamlines Unfollowing**: Easily unfollow users in bulk, saving time when managing your connections.
- **User-Friendly**: Works seamlessly on GitHub's profile pages and followers/following lists, integrating into your browsing experience.

### How It Works

This script is powered by JavaScript and runs through Tampermonkey, a popular browser extension for userscripts. Once installed, it adds functionality to GitHub's interface, allowing you to perform follow and unfollow actions with minimal effort. It's compatible with Chromium-based browsers (like Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera) and Firefox, ensuring broad accessibility.

### Why Use It?

- **Efficiency**: Perfect for users who manage large networks or engage with many GitHub profiles regularly.
- **Simplicity**: No complex setupâ€”just install the script via Tampermonkey and start using it.
- **Up-to-Date**: Still fully functional as of 2025, tested to work with GitHub's latest interface.
