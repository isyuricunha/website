My personal website and blog.

I see a lot of websites on the Internet. Blog, I want to create my own blog where I can write whatever I want. Regardless of the tutorial, notes, or journal. Therefore, I started learning web development skills on December 5, 2020. First, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After a year, I found that a static website was not enough for me. And I started learning React.js, then Next.js.
