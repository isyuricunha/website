We've all been there: you create a new directory with `mkdir` and then immediately have to `cd` into it.

```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
```

It's a small friction, but it adds up. Here is a simple function to do both at once.

## The Solution

Add this function to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`):

```bash
# Create a folder (and subfolders) and enter it immediately
mkcd() {
  mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}
```

## How to Install

1.  Open your config file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
2.  Paste the code block above at the end of the file.
3.  Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).
4.  Reload your configuration:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

## Usage

Now you can create deep directory structures and enter them instantly:

```bash
mkcd docker/docker-compose/vaultwarden
```

You will find yourself inside `vaultwarden` immediately.
