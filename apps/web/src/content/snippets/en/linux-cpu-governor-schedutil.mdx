The `schedutil` governor is often the best choice for modern kernels, using scheduler utilization data to make faster and more accurate frequency decisions than older governors like `ondemand`.

Here is how to enable it and make it persistent.

## 1. Install Tools

First, ensure you have the necessary tools installed. On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic
```

## 2. Set Governor (Immediate)

You can set the governor immediately for the current session. It's good practice to set the frequency limits as well.

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g schedutil
# Optional: explicitly set limits if needed, though usually automatic
# sudo cpupower frequency-set -g powersave
# sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

### Verify

Check if the policy has been applied:

```bash
cpupower frequency-info | grep "current policy" -A2
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 3.60 GHz.
                The governor "schedutil" may decide which speed to use
```

To double-check individual CPUs:

```bash
grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

All cores should report `schedutil`.

## 3. Make Persistent (Systemd)

To ensure this setting survives a reboot, create a simple systemd service.

Create the service file:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cpupower-schedutil.service >/dev/null << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Set CPU governor to schedutil
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cpupower frequency-set -g schedutil

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cpupower-schedutil.service
sudo systemctl start cpupower-schedutil.service
```

After starting, run the verification command again to confirm it's working.

## 4. Cleanup (Optional)

If you previously created a service for high performance (e.g., `cpupower-performance.service`), you should disable and remove it to avoid conflicts.

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now cpupower-performance.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/cpupower-performance.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Your server is now configured to use `schedutil` automatically on every boot.
