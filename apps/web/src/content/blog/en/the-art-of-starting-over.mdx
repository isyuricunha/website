To begin again. A beautiful and very significant word, which can be used in so many moments of our lives. To start over. It always seems to be the best answer for those who often need to recognize that the path traced so far has not provided the desired fruits. And faced with the closed door of a lost opportunity, we simply need to: return. Restart, reinvent, rebuild.

And how many times do we need to watch a part of ourselves die to finally rediscover the true meaning of (re)starting. From scratch, without pride, without shame, without fear, but with baggage. Good experiences and learning from everything that went wrong. But it is necessary, therefore, to know how to carry the right experiences, or we will be frighteningly haunted by fear. Failure, when not well-conditioned within us, destroys us little by little, paralyzes us, blocks us. And fear does not need to be a limiting factor, but rather a caution.

To believe again. A difficult action when one has lost hope in what should have value. Even worse when we stop believing in ourselves. It is difficult to live this experience of, little by little, unintentionally, starting a process of self-sabotage. How many times do we let the opinions of others destroy us from within. They say all the time in almost everything we do: “You won’t make it!”, “You don’t have the ability” or even, “This is not for you!”. It is always easier, in the face of the countless difficulties that arise on our journey, to believe in inability, in non-realization, to believe that life is even more difficult than it already seems. But living is this: almost dying so many times, to learn to be reborn, to be even stronger. To fall a thousand times, to get up a thousand and one. To relive, to be reborn, to recognize. Yes, to recognize is this, to know again, to have the opportunity to learn something in life, but in the right way. To know that we made mistakes, but that we can relearn what is necessary. It is always time to change, to improve, to grow. It is always time to break free. Let go of the ties, surrender to the unknown, without more questions. Simply seek to live, without expecting anything in return. Live the simplicity of rediscovering yourself in each step.

But notice, our life is this, a portion of “Re’s”, have you noticed? Life is a cycle, that when well-lived, leads us to the best of ourselves.

What leads us more easily to the state of being sublime? What attitude should we have when, in the face of a process, we want to obtain continuous improvement? That’s right, the answer involves several magic words already said: To restart, to relearn, to relive, to be reborn, to reinvent, to restore, to reboot, to rebuild… We must always, therefore, redo, rethink our actions and our attitudes, because there are always thousands of details that we still do not see, other countless lessons to be learned, other thousand new paths to be traveled. To live is immensity. To live is the opportunity to be fully realized, happy, led back to the real beauty of our soul.

We are fully capable and despite all our flaws and possible limitations, each one has a beautiful talent, a beautiful mission. Each one carries within themselves a great opportunity. We are worthily blessed, but we waste what we are when we stop climbing to the top of the podium of our daily lives, to be content with last place. We lose ourselves from what we are when we constantly let ourselves be carried away by weaknesses. We pollute ourselves when, upon laying our head on the pillow, we fail to correct ourselves and seek to improve, to justify and find acceptable everything we do wrong.

Have you noticed how many times, when we do wrong even without meaning to, we look for excuses not to correct ourselves? How many times are we so proud that we harm or hurt others in some way, in the name of our false truths, to feel stronger? To not admit how human we are? But know that weak is not the one who recognizes being wrong, who recognizes their deficiencies, who puts pride aside to value the right things. Nor is the one who, in the face of storms, lets themselves fall weak. Truly weak is the one who lives with the arrogance of thinking they are superior to others. Weak is the one who does not know how to live the process of humility. Who thinks that their wills, their desires, their choices, must always be realized, even if it may harm or hurt someone. Weak is the one who does not know how to love. Weak is the one who does not allow themselves to live the essence of fraternity, who does not strive for good values. It is not easy to be good, which is why few truly are, but there are many battling to truly be.

In the face of rebirths, new beginnings, reinventions, rediscoveries, reconstructions, and so many other processes necessary for our well-being, we develop our maturity. We thus stop wanting so much what does not matter, we learn to value the right people, to love those who love us in an appropriate way. We learn to be more authentic, to be who we should be, without masks, without inventions. We learn to value our feelings, our body, our life. With time, we finally realize that we cannot change the facts, and in the face of this, we let the facts change our reality, after all, events are factors of transformation in us. Maturity is not ceasing to be a child. Not necessarily, because it is necessary to stop being one in the right way. We let go of attachment, the childish way of wanting everything for ourselves. But we should maintain the truth, the sincerity, and above all, the simplicity. A child is enchanted by the rainbow, by the sunset, by an insect in the garden, by the taste of rain, by the small details of a landscape. We cannot lose this vision of enchantment, because when we stop admiring the beauty of small things, life loses its grace. When there are no more surprises, there is no more life. It is the death of the essence of the soul.

And even with stumbles and tired feet of someone who is lost and does not know where to go, may the sun show the beauty of a new beginning. May the rays of light allow the eyes of those who do not see what they see to open, so that they can have the necessary enchantment for life. May they not forget the beauty they carry. May they not let what is in their heart die, the goodness they carry in their soul. May there always be enough light to illuminate the darkness of our being. It is always time to start over. It is always time to love ourselves and to love others as they are. It is always time to believe. It is always time to forgive others, but it is essential that we can forgive ourselves. To be reborn, in the face of the love we carry, the goodness we can spread, what we truly are. To live is to never forget to return, as many times as necessary, to ourselves. To what we can never stop being. May we always be our own best friend and not our greatest enemy. May we never stop walking, taking steps. May we never let the light we carry go out. May we never stop fighting. May we always know how to revisit the most beautiful territories of our soul and our heart.
