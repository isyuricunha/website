## Preface

Recently, I've gathered a collection of exceptional websites in UI/UX design that left me in awe upon my initial exploration. I believe these websites can greatly enrich your UI skills. Here's a list of my top 8 favorite websites (in no particular order).

## Raycast

Raycast is a productivity tool that enables fast task completion. Its homepage captivated me with its UI design, featuring my favorite gradient colors and various shades of red (the theme color).

Scrolling down showcases its unique features, clearly demonstrating its product capabilities. This led me to promptly download the software after purchasing a [MacBook Air 15"](/uses). The effort put into image creation, UI design, and color selection by their developers is evident on the website and is worth learning from.

Whether designing new products, updating existing ones, handling feedback, or tasks, Linear provides collaboration tools and workflows to ensure efficient project execution. Through Linear, design teams can collaborate better, track progress, and ensure effective management at every stage.

It emphasizes performance and scalability, providing powerful server-side rendering and static website generation capabilities that optimize webpage loading speed and SEO performance. Whether building dynamic applications or static content websites, Next.js simplifies development processes and offers superior user experiences.

The minimalist design of the Next.js official website is sophisticated, and the most interesting part is the "Powered By" section—a "CPU" created using CSS, surprising but effective.
