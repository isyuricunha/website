      <title>The Art of Starting Over</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To begin again. A beautiful and very significant word, which can be used in so many moments of our lives. To start over. It always seems to be the best answer for those who often need to recognize that the path traced so far has not provided the desired fruits. And faced with the closed door of a lost opportunity, we simply need to: return. Restart, reinvent, rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how many times do we need to watch a part of ourselves die to finally rediscover the true meaning of (re)starting. From scratch, without pride, without shame, without fear, but with baggage. Good experiences and learning from everything that went wrong. But it is necessary, therefore, to know how to carry the right experiences, or we will be frighteningly haunted by fear. Failure, when not well-conditioned within us, destroys us little by little, paralyzes us, blocks us. And fear does not need to be a limiting factor, but rather a caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To believe again. A difficult action when one has lost hope in what should have value. Even worse when we stop believing in ourselves. It is difficult to live this experience of, little by little, unintentionally, starting a process of self-sabotage. How many times do we let the opinions of others destroy us from within. They say all the time in almost everything we do: “You won’t make it!”, “You don’t have the ability” or even, “This is not for you!”. It is always easier, in the face of the countless difficulties that arise on our journey, to believe in inability, in non-realization, to believe that life is even more difficult than it already seems. But living is this: almost dying so many times, to learn to be reborn, to be even stronger. To fall a thousand times, to get up a thousand and one. To relive, to be reborn, to recognize. Yes, to recognize is this, to know again, to have the opportunity to learn something in life, but in the right way. To know that we made mistakes, but that we can relearn what is necessary. It is always time to change, to improve, to grow. It is always time to break free. Let go of the ties, surrender to the unknown, without more questions. Simply seek to live, without expecting anything in return. Live the simplicity of rediscovering yourself in each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But notice, our life is this, a portion of “Re’s”, have you noticed? Life is a cycle, that when well-lived, leads us to the best of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What leads us more easily to the state of being sublime? What attitude should we have when, in the face of a process, we want to obtain continuous improvement? That’s right, the answer involves several magic words already said: To restart, to relearn, to relive, to be reborn, to reinvent, to restore, to reboot, to rebuild… We must always, therefore, redo, rethink our actions and our attitudes, because there are always thousands of details that we still do not see, other countless lessons to be learned, other thousand new paths to be traveled. To live is immensity. To live is the opportunity to be fully realized, happy, led back to the real beauty of our soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are fully capable and despite all our flaws and possible limitations, each one has a beautiful talent, a beautiful mission. Each one carries within themselves a great opportunity. We are worthily blessed, but we waste what we are when we stop climbing to the top of the podium of our daily lives, to be content with last place. We lose ourselves from what we are when we constantly let ourselves be carried away by weaknesses. We pollute ourselves when, upon laying our head on the pillow, we fail to correct ourselves and seek to improve, to justify and find acceptable everything we do wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed how many times, when we do wrong even without meaning to, we look for excuses not to correct ourselves? How many times are we so proud that we harm or hurt others in some way, in the name of our false truths, to feel stronger? To not admit how human we are? But know that weak is not the one who recognizes being wrong, who recognizes their deficiencies, who puts pride aside to value the right things. Nor is the one who, in the face of storms, lets themselves fall weak. Truly weak is the one who lives with the arrogance of thinking they are superior to others. Weak is the one who does not know how to live the process of humility. Who thinks that their wills, their desires, their choices, must always be realized, even if it may harm or hurt someone. Weak is the one who does not know how to love. Weak is the one who does not allow themselves to live the essence of fraternity, who does not strive for good values. It is not easy to be good, which is why few truly are, but there are many battling to truly be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of rebirths, new beginnings, reinventions, rediscoveries, reconstructions, and so many other processes necessary for our well-being, we develop our maturity. We thus stop wanting so much what does not matter, we learn to value the right people, to love those who love us in an appropriate way. We learn to be more authentic, to be who we should be, without masks, without inventions. We learn to value our feelings, our body, our life. With time, we finally realize that we cannot change the facts, and in the face of this, we let the facts change our reality, after all, events are factors of transformation in us. Maturity is not ceasing to be a child. Not necessarily, because it is necessary to stop being one in the right way. We let go of attachment, the childish way of wanting everything for ourselves. But we should maintain the truth, the sincerity, and above all, the simplicity. A child is enchanted by the rainbow, by the sunset, by an insect in the garden, by the taste of rain, by the small details of a landscape. We cannot lose this vision of enchantment, because when we stop admiring the beauty of small things, life loses its grace. When there are no more surprises, there is no more life. It is the death of the essence of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with stumbles and tired feet of someone who is lost and does not know where to go, may the sun show the beauty of a new beginning. May the rays of light allow the eyes of those who do not see what they see to open, so that they can have the necessary enchantment for life. May they not forget the beauty they carry. May they not let what is in their heart die, the goodness they carry in their soul. May there always be enough light to illuminate the darkness of our being. It is always time to start over. It is always time to love ourselves and to love others as they are. It is always time to believe. It is always time to forgive others, but it is essential that we can forgive ourselves. To be reborn, in the face of the love we carry, the goodness we can spread, what we truly are. To live is to never forget to return, as many times as necessary, to ourselves. To what we can never stop being. May we always be our own best friend and not our greatest enemy. May we never stop walking, taking steps. May we never let the light we carry go out. May we never stop fighting. May we always know how to revisit the most beautiful territories of our soul and our heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>the pleasure of doing nothing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;today is friday here in espírito santo, and the rain falls like a soft melody that cradles my thoughts. living in a cozy apartment, far from the hustle and bustle, i find myself alone—a contrast amid the hectic routine of working with servers and databases. in a universe where every byte and every script seem to demand attention, today i allowed myself a break, a moment of pure relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;early in the morning, after a strong and unhurried coffee, i realized that the day was unfolding gently and promisingly. with no urgent notifications and no critical digital infrastructure demands, the surrounding environment remained quiet and orderly. the apartment was immaculate, and, curiously, the absence of exercise—which i normally avoided—allowed me to imagine a day without the pressure to do something “productive.” it was an irresistible invitation to dive into calmness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before opening my laptop, i sat in silence, letting my thoughts reveal themselves one by one. in that moment, my mind began to whisper: “maybe it’s time to review that old server log? or perhaps check if that backup script can be optimized?” these murmurs resembled an unsteady conversation, a sort of alert that insists on transforming every pause into a whirlwind of ideas and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then i recalled a simple yet transformative technique to deal with this incessant flow of thoughts. imagine each thought with a unique shape, almost as if it were alive. give them names—they could be john, anna, or even a casual nickname that reflects their personality. in my case, these virtual “friends” appear with suggestions about adjustments and improvements: “adjust the server configuration,” “check that database query,” or “remember to update the security software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but, while picturing this scene, i realized that i am not a hostage to these reminders. i am the host of this silent meeting, the one who decides which piece of advice deserves a response and which can be left aside. just as one can listen to an old friend without necessarily following all of their recommendations, i have learned to give room only to what truly matters. today, i choose to listen to these voices with serenity and respond with a simple, yet firm, “thank you, but it’s fine as it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the feeling of freedom is almost palpable. instead of turning every minute of rest into a frantic search for new challenges, i choose to enjoy the simple fact of being present, savoring this break without obligations. because, in the end, life often traps us in the idea that every moment must be invested in something grand or revolutionary. yet, there is an undeniable beauty in the simplicity of doing nothing—a space where creativity and peace meet without haste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on this rainy and peaceful day, i allow myself to linger, contemplating the rain, the distant sound of water hitting the windows, and the calm that envelops the surroundings. each raindrop reminds me that nature, too, knows the art of resting, of renewing itself without the need for excess. it is in this natural rhythm that i find inspiration to rethink my own priorities, to recognize that sometimes the true value lies in the pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;between one thought and another, a new perspective reveals itself: the paradox between digital productivity and the necessary rest of body and mind. i work with the precision of servers, but i have also learned that the human system needs breaks—moments to defragment and reorganize memory, even if it means simply appreciating the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the end, i decide to click the “publish” button—not to launch a new project, but to record this moment of serenity. i close my laptop and allow myself, for a few precious hours, to be at peace with myself. without the rush to resolve pending issues or adjust configurations, i embrace this moment of pure existence, where calm becomes the greatest gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you, my restless thoughts. today, i learned that tranquility is found not in the constant search for solutions, but in the wisdom of letting time follow its course. by recognizing that i can be the manager of my own thoughts, i enjoy the simple pleasure of doing nothing—and, through that, i discover a new kind of productivity: the productivity of being.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>echoes of a conflicted impostor</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/echoes-of-a-conflicted-impostor/echoes-of-a-conflicted-impostor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:20:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/echoes-of-a-conflicted-impostor/echoes-of-a-conflicted-impostor/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wandering these same shadowed corridors of my mind, &lt;a href=&#34;https://yuricunha.com/post/reflections-of-a-conflicted-impostor&#34;&gt;questioning every step I&amp;rsquo;ve taken since that confession of failure&lt;/a&gt;. It’s strange—while admitting my shortcomings felt like an honest release at the time, the aftermath has only deepened the maze. I find myself retracing old paths, looking for signs of a truth I can cling to. There are moments when I catch a glimpse of the person I once hoped to become: confident, curious, driven. Yet, that image quickly dissolves into the persistent murmur of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed how the smallest victories—solving a problem at work, a brief moment of genuine laughter with a friend—feel less like triumphs and more like fleeting distractions from the overwhelming sensation of inadequacy. It&amp;rsquo;s as if each success, instead of building a solid foundation, only casts a longer, darker shadow of what might come next. The irony isn’t lost on me: for someone who meticulously built a portfolio admired by many, my inner critic still insists that I’m an impostor living a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quiet hours of the night, when the world sleeps and my thoughts echo too loudly, I wonder if this is my penance for having dared to dream beyond the limits imposed by others. Is the pain of self-doubt proportional to the size of my ambitions? Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a cruel reminder that even with accolades and certifications, the true measure of worth isn’t found in external achievements, but in an elusive internal harmony that seems forever out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall moments when I would immerse myself in music, letting each note peel away the layers of my pretenses. Dancing alone in the solitude of my room, I felt both free and condemned—free because I could finally express what words often failed to capture, and condemned because, in that solitude, I was forced face-to-face with every fragmented part of me. Those nights, filled with raw emotion and introspection, reveal how deeply entwined my identity is with my fears and hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family and friendships, too, have taken on new dimensions. I’ve learned that while some relationships are meant to uplift, others mirror back our imperfections, sometimes harsher than any inner judgment could. The bonds that once promised support occasionally remind me that vulnerability is a double-edged sword, capable of forging connections and, simultaneously, exposing every crack in our self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey has evolved into a delicate balancing act—acknowledging my failures without letting them define me, embracing moments of joy without dismissing the persistent echo of inadequacy. Perhaps the paradox lies in the very act of trying to be better: the more I strive, the more I seem to uncover the infinite nuances of what it means to be flawed, to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are days when I’m haunted by the memories of harsh words and cold dismissals from those whose approval I once craved. Their voices, once so distant, now resurface unbidden, questioning every decision and every misstep. Yet, amid the noise, I’ve also discovered unexpected allies—strangers who see the same struggles in their reflections, and whose own stories of failure resonate with mine. It’s a bittersweet comfort: to know that while my pain is uniquely mine, it is also shared by countless others who navigate similar inner storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wonder: am I simply a mosaic of contradictions—a brilliant mind trapped in a body that feels perpetually out of sync? Or is it that, in every instance of self-doubt, there lies an invitation to explore a different facet of who I can become? There’s a strange beauty in this uncertainty, a kind of raw potential that refuses to be neatly defined by success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this ongoing dialogue with myself, I’ve begun to see that perhaps the goal isn’t to erase the failures, but to understand them—each misstep a lesson, each doubt a question that propels me toward a deeper self-awareness. The path ahead isn’t lit by the certainty of achievement, but by the willingness to confront and embrace the messy, unpredictable nature of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, still standing at the crossroads of despair and possibility, listening to the silent symphony of my inner voice. I may never fully resolve the conflict between the impostor I fear and the person I aspire to be, but I’ve come to accept that this tension is an integral part of my story. And in that acceptance, perhaps, lies the beginning of a new chapter—a chapter where failure isn’t the end, but the raw material from which resilience is forged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to wander these familiar halls of reflection, not in search of a final answer, but to keep asking the questions that make me feel alive. Every day is a dialogue with uncertainty, a step toward embracing the full, unfiltered spectrum of my existence. And maybe, just maybe, in that relentless questioning, I will find a way to be both flawed and whole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>when everything begins to happen within</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/when-everything-begins-to-happen-within/when-everything-begins-to-happen-within/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No matter how much the world spins, how many pages the calendar sheds as the months pass. No matter the paths we walk, the people who drift through our days, or the countless events swirling around us each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something becomes meaningful when it touches us in some way. It’s the way we look, the way we listen, the chance to see what we’ve never allowed ourselves to notice. Everything feels utterly unremarkable unless it captivates us in a meaningful way. A book is only good if we connect with it—if it awakens joy, dreams, and possibilities, even unreal ones. A book is only good when it makes us dream and live the greatest story without leaving our seat. We must see every detail with our heart, our soul, with the taste of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a book. Your book. How have you responded to the stories written in its chapters? Can you truly smile? Did you manage to laugh at least once today? How do you react to the details of your day as seen through your own eyes? Can you laugh at your stumbles and keep moving forward, or do you obsess over why you weren’t &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to avoid falling? Can you embrace &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to seek a new &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;? Have you paused, even for a moment, to look up at the sky and see the stars always shining on your path? Have you stopped to marvel at how incredible that is? We are grains of sand in an infinite universe. But have you considered the immensity of feeling? The scent of perfume, the aroma of morning coffee, the intoxicating fragrance of life that intoxicates us daily as a new opportunity. The taste of loving deeply. Of risking a new step. Of stepping into the unknown abyss. Of stealing a kiss, giving the warmest embrace you can muster. Of showing your feelings without fear of being ignored, misunderstood, or seeming foolish or crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, as I walk my own path, I’ve realized: everything around us changes when we let everything happen here—inside me. Inside you. We must permit ourselves new ways of seeing our days, new ways of understanding our emotions, new ways of striving to thrive. Often, everything shifts when we shift our perspective. When we step beyond our comfort zone. When we stop settling for mediocrity in our habitual way of living. Life becomes predictable when we ignore the magic in every detail. When we let routine numb our senses and dictate how we react to the expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you surprised anyone today? Yesterday? This month? Have you done something you’re proud of? Was it out of the ordinary, or part of your routine? Have you been surprised? Yes, I know—it sounds repetitive. But there are endless ways to feel something new. Endless ways to see the same day. To find beauty along the journey. And the path we walk is far more beautiful when shared with someone special—to share dreams, hugs, smiles, tenderness. To share different perspectives, unique dreams, and common joys. Have you ever stopped to think how precious those people are? The ones whose simplicity makes us laugh, who understand us, and create something wondrous within us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why loving someone and being loved in return is extraordinary. Because suddenly, everything begins to unfold within us. Life gains a new flavor. Familiar places feel transformed. Paths that once felt burdensome become lighter. Routines that once dimmed our spirits now crack open to reveal new opportunities. The scent of fresh coffee in the morning awakens us to the day—but great love awakens us to life. And if that love isn’t found in another, let it at least begin with the essential: love for yourself. The ability to laugh at your mistakes, your flaws, and your struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a fleeting breath. But like a breath, we can shake off the dust and awaken to new wonders as we live. This doesn’t mean we won’t face hardships or profound sorrows—it means that seeking new ways to interpret life’s gestures, words, and challenges helps us find strength when storms arrive. It’s the light of the sun, and the light we carry within, that will guide us to dawn after a dark night. Everything is transient—including each of us. But as long as we live, there is always a chance to begin anew. To grow. To thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherish the journey. See it through the eyes of your heart. Every moment is a gift, a miracle, a blessing. Every stumble, every hardship, every scar is often a lesson waiting to be learned. Every person who crosses your path is unique—a teacher, a gift, a memory sweet or bitter. We become what we choose to keep from each encounter. We are a collection of moments, people, and emotions—a tapestry of experiences, memories, and feelings. Why not keep the best of everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those who’ve changed your life for the better, who still walk beside you—have you taken pride in what you’ve become to them? Have you held their hands, even when it’s hard? Do you show your affection daily? Do you let yourself feel, or do you fear judgment? A kind word can alter someone’s day. A small surprise can become a lifelong memory. You can be better than you are—so be. Move with grace, unafraid to be yourself. Don’t wait to see “what could have been” when the chance is gone. Let yourself be amazed. Let yourself notice the details. So much beauty hides in every moment—discover it. Life is allowing yourself to marvel at the mysteries within the mundane. If life is a song, dare to discover new rhythms and melodies for the same chorus. Everything changes when you start truly feeling what stirs within you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>pretending to be okay</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/pretending-to-be-okay/pretending-to-be-okay/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 08:46:00 -0300</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s curious how behind the most beautiful smiles, the most decisive words from people who seem so accomplished, reality isn&amp;rsquo;t always what it appears to be. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to conclude that someone is happy by looking at selfies on social media, the passionate photos, the numerous posts where everything suggests that this person&amp;rsquo;s professional life is great, their health is in check, and love, of course, is abundant and going very well, thank you. It&amp;rsquo;s always very easy to conclude without knowing the true reality. And how often we do this. But the truth is, in more sincere conversations, with complicity and empathy, we discover that the castle of appearances is a fragile mask that so many people wear to convince themselves they&amp;rsquo;re okay, to hide. And thus, many try to seek satisfaction in excessive consumerism, in fleeting and superficial relationships that never truly satisfy. There are various ways we use to try to avoid facing our own torments, our fears, our doubts, and our own consciousness. To confront our inner struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often, we end up resorting to what seems easier: we pretend to be fine. We pretend to smile when so many times we want to cry. We pretend to believe in better days when, in truth, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what to believe. We avoid facing our torments the right way. And worse, we often feel unhappy and compare ourselves precisely with those people who try to show a life that is far from reality. And from all this, we believe we are filled with an emptiness that seems endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many flaunt smiles in photos and daily life. But it&amp;rsquo;s the pillow that bears the tears and laments at the end of each day. It&amp;rsquo;s before sleep that the ghosts of reality haunt. There&amp;rsquo;s always a moment when our conscience questions our actions. It&amp;rsquo;s when it weighs on us for our mistakes or gives us the peace to lay our heads on the pillow in tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so often, nostalgia grips our hearts, and we end up suffering so much, dreaming of the possibility of going back in time, but only memories of the good days remain. We punish ourselves each day for the mistakes committed, which have cost us dearly, many times. There&amp;rsquo;s no escape because in many situations, we end up being hostages to ourselves. We carry the burden of not having done good when it was truly needed. We relive the rot left by offenses, aggressions, lies, and betrayals. And it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to hold grudges because we didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to expel what is no longer good or valuable. We keep resentments from what we never had the courage to face and accept as a lesson in our hearts. We blame others when we barely realize that we also bear a significant share of the blame. When we should have more empathy. We are saddened by bringing back into our lives those who should never have returned, forgetting that we should be more demanding and love ourselves more. We hurt ourselves so much and hurt others even more, not knowing that sometimes, we need to know when to be silent, to hush. Because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to say. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to question; one must simply protect oneself, shield oneself from our own evils and those of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, when we&amp;rsquo;re in a difficult situation in a relationship, at a moment in our life, or even facing a decision we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to handle, we simply go mad, turning to friends, family, partners, husbands, or wives. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the opinions of those who truly care about us are worth consulting and considering. However, it becomes increasingly clear how much we flee from facing who we are. We flee from translating our feelings, from understanding without haste what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside us first. And thus, we turn to others so much, but in the end, days pass, and we continue to be great unknowns to ourselves. We flee from understanding who we are, what we feel, what we dream, what we love, and what we want. We think we know, when in truth, we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet explored the core of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be well, one must discover oneself anew each day. One must seek directly from the source the greatest dreams and desires. It&amp;rsquo;s necessary to free oneself to be who one truly is. Without theater, without hypocrisy. To know how we will truly be fulfilled, we need to know ourselves. Know our abilities, but also know how to touch the right point of the wound. Go through the process of understanding the reason for our pains, the motive for our lies. And we&amp;rsquo;re always lying to ourselves so much. And even sadder is when we catch ourselves lying to others, especially those we love so much, out of fear of reactions, judgments, and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s so good to live lightly, to free what binds us, to reveal what we truly are, without making the other a prisoner of the illusions we create, of the performances we put on out of fear of what they will think of what we essentially are. We need to stop this nonsense of creating a character that doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent us to impress others, to be more compatible with someone. It&amp;rsquo;s so beautiful to be genuine. And thus, we should be in our relationships. It&amp;rsquo;s very cruel to awaken someone&amp;rsquo;s love through what we&amp;rsquo;ve never been, through lies that can surface at any time and then bring great sorrow. Trust, once broken, can undermine all chances of building something with the solid foundations of truth, which are indispensable for lasting relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s necessary to be aware of our mistakes, our flaws, our shortcomings, and still, not stop improving. Not stop loving ourselves and recognizing that we are an unfinished work, but even with imperfections, can be even more beautiful. Realize that if you erred today, you can get it right tomorrow. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t forgive today, there&amp;rsquo;s still time to forgive tomorrow. And forgiving is a beautiful work of cleaning the dirt left in us. It must be clear that it&amp;rsquo;s a purification process, separate from reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many unhappy people, always seeking happiness and a reason to live in someone else. And thus, they make the mistake of projecting onto others a responsibility that has always been exclusively ours, each one of us. We must no longer allow ourselves to form unhealthy emotional bonds. Pouring into the other the reason to live. Falsely believing that we always need someone to be okay with ourselves. That&amp;rsquo;s a tremendous lie, a painful illusion. Love is necessary, relationships are important, but we need to go through the process of self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to stop looking only at others and look at ourselves, reflect on our behaviors with people. But truly, without the barrier of selfishness that naturally exists in us. We need to learn to understand ourselves, to learn to be happy alone. To live with who we are and accept ourselves. Stop lamenting and finally discover within us the bonds we have with life. Dreams and desires are bonds that should be perpetual. When we stop dreaming, we lose our connection with life. When we stop making plans, we stop wanting to live. There are so many sad and depressed people because they look too much outward, worrying too much about others, and forget to look truly inward. We forget to see the essential that lives within us, the treasures and riches we hold. We become strangers, misunderstood by ourselves, overflowing with anxiety, nervousness, sadness, depression, and so many destructive things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to think that happiness only exists when we no longer have problems. But the truth is that happiness becomes closer when there&amp;rsquo;s a commitment to it. And when we commit to seeking it, little by little, we learn to give less importance to problems. Problems make us unhappy not because of their magnitude or severity, but due to how we treat them. Problems will always exist, but it&amp;rsquo;s how we confront them that will impact how we live. And I repeat, suffering often tears us apart because we don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to face it. Again, we flee. We flee from learning because we&amp;rsquo;re paralyzed before a situation and don&amp;rsquo;t see the solution. That&amp;rsquo;s why we lose hope. Because our attitude towards the situation is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are what we feed. We pretend not, but we see and even feel ashamed of so many actions. But what do we often prefer to do? Simply feed what seems easier: we get comfortable and think our actions weren&amp;rsquo;t that wrong, not that serious or worthy of correction. That nothing is wrong, and often, we believe the problem lies with others. And thus, we leave aside the possibility of improvement. We stop being better because it&amp;rsquo;s a harder path to take. But know it&amp;rsquo;s the path most filled with meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many times, we hypocritically say that our &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; today is not the same as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;I.&amp;rdquo; And indeed, it&amp;rsquo;s true! But is your &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; today better or worse than yesterday&amp;rsquo;s? And believe me, often it&amp;rsquo;s worse, because we didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to face with humility the difficulties that need to be improved and alleviated. We always prefer to lament. We always prefer to sabotage ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always feel filled with a great emptiness because we don&amp;rsquo;t know what can fill us. We don&amp;rsquo;t truly know what we carry within us. This emptiness can have so many answers, but we need to learn to ask the right questions. We might be surprised to realize that there was never an emptiness and we could have been much more complete. We could finally understand what we truly are and thus love ourselves more. We need to stop cultivating what others see through appearances and start properly watering the garden of our soul. Being happy is for those determined to make the necessary sacrifices to strive for self-improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s knowing that you know very little, but remaining hungry to explore the infinite unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no greater beauty than someone who understands themselves. Someone who allows themselves to be, who loves themselves, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t sabotage themselves. Someone who knows their limits but isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to push beyond them. Someone who goes through the storm of loneliness because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to live wisely in the moments they are alone. And solitude, when processed well, can propel us even further because we start to understand the silence that speaks volumes without uttering a single word. We must understand that it&amp;rsquo;s no use having others, loves, different presences in our lives if we don&amp;rsquo;t seek to cultivate our own company. If we don&amp;rsquo;t, in our solitary moments, complete ourselves with what we are, with what we feel, and what we spread, if we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to deal with our fears, our pains, our wounds, our mistakes. If we don&amp;rsquo;t know who we truly are, we&amp;rsquo;ll always be lonely, even in a vast crowd, even next to a great love or with all our family gathered around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to have the courage to face the voids of the unexplored, of the unknown universe of our own soul. Those who seek to know themselves and fall in love with themselves every day, those who face their own wounds, will never be alone. There are always feelings to be understood, reasons to be questioned, new worlds to be visited. Want to be happy? First, know yourself. Face who you are. Face what you feel. Don&amp;rsquo;t lament the superficial, but dive into the unknown with all courage. The answers are ready to be answered, but you need to start now asking the necessary questions. You need to dare to take actions that push you out of your comfort zone. Don&amp;rsquo;t lose your enchantment with life. Don&amp;rsquo;t lose your connections. Don&amp;rsquo;t stop dreaming. And you&amp;rsquo;ll know that you were never a great emptiness, nor an eternal desert, but rather a vast universe that you need to, and soon will, explore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>what if everything goes wrong?</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/what-if-everything-goes-wrong/what-if-everything-goes-wrong/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 21:46:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/what-if-everything-goes-wrong/what-if-everything-goes-wrong/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything has been going so well lately. Life once felt so heavy, full of battles, storms, and strong currents. But now, I wake up feeling different. It seems like after losing so much, it’s finally time to win. Things are changing, and new events are bringing a fresh spice to my once monotonous routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everything seems to go wrong, when dreams are interrupted, and when what we often believe in is lost, it becomes harder and harder to trust that things will eventually improve. I’ve had days when just getting out of bed came with a certain fear of the 24 hours ahead. Sometimes, a single moment would lift my spirits, but before the day ended, everything seemed to crumble again. I thought about giving up a thousand times but always got back up to move forward. I splashed water on my face, tucked my fear into my pocket, and carried courage in my chest. Slowly, I began to lift my head, navigating through the river created by the storm of problems, hoping it would lead me to a place where I could start over, believe again, find strength to row, and learn to stand tall to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each day, dissatisfied, I saw all that needed to change and felt an unconscious pressure to keep sabotaging myself. I wanted to complain less but didn’t fight more. I wanted to think less but couldn’t stop overplanning. I wished to start pursuing that dream right away, but I kept saying, “Tomorrow, I’ll begin.” Every night before sleep, I’d catch myself wishing, “May tomorrow be better than today.” Slowly, I realized how routine enslaves us, confines us. We expect more but do the same. But good results only come when we allow ourselves to be different, to break free from the molds we’ve placed on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to find ourselves, but almost always in the wrong ways. Sometimes, we need to let go, to simply trust. We need to lose to reflect and try again, a thousand times if needed, until success becomes reality. We must always change and improve. And everything only began to transform when I changed what needed to be changed within myself—without victimhood, without fear of shaking my foundations, confronting my wounds, acknowledging my pride and shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After so many stumbles, I blindly wanted to get everything right. In moments of desperation, I longed for someone to love. But how could I love someone when I wasn’t even sure how much I loved myself? The truth is, sadness and pain throw dust in our eyes, making us feel incapable of being happy again. We let pain tame us so deeply that we train ourselves to endure suffering. And when happiness finally arrives, our greatest fear emerges: What if everything starts going wrong again? What if the happiness we’re glimpsing is just a fleeting rainbow that vanishes the moment we admire it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t want happiness and good moments to last forever? For happiness to enter our lives and never want to leave, finding a permanent place in our homes, our days, our hearts? Who wouldn’t want peace amid the battles we fight every day—to not give up, to not succumb? But happiness, as the song says, is a matter of being, of knowing how to wait, letting it go, trusting that it will return. And it does—it always does—if we just keep moving forward, fighting without expecting too much. We improve one thing here, another there. Happiness is a journey to explore, including finding beauty in the cloudy skies of sad days. It’s learning from pain, not just enduring it. It’s knowing how to rise after falling. It’s believing in yourself when no one else seems to. If we don’t value ourselves, who will? In the gamble of life, we must always bet the most on ourselves—without excuses, without complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After betting so much on myself, now that I’ve started winning, others want to bet on me too. After doubting if I loved myself, I now see how much I do. And by loving myself, I feel far more ready to love someone else. When faced with a beautiful smile, I’ll give my truest smile in return. And if she faces storms of her own, I’ll know at least how to be more than just anyone. But then people ask if I’ll only be happy when I have love. The truth is, I’ll have love because I’m happy. Happiness attracts happiness. Positive thoughts repel the negative. Happiness fills an empty heart with so much more love—for life, for moments, for people, for words, for sounds, for dreams, for the wind that brushes the face of those who allow themselves to be free, unchained by consequences. Life happens when everything begins to happen within us. And if someone hasn’t arrived yet, I still believe. I’ll keep moving forward, content without needing that someone else. I want to be more than a sum; I aim to be more than a complement. No halves here—we’ll both be whole, and together, if we choose, we’ll create one love in two hearts. And just thinking about it, I wait without truly waiting. I’m preparing my heart for whoever may come. My intensity will never change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if everything goes wrong? I’ll be ready to start rowing again, with the wisdom of someone who knows that it will pass. If things go awry, we’ll find a way. We’ll start over, knowing we’re imperfect. But for now, I’ll do my best to get it right, fully aware that I might fail. And when I fail, I won’t lose heart. If everything I now live so lightly falls apart, that’s okay. In time, I’ll experience equal or even greater happiness. It might take a while—I’m in no rush. I won’t lose faith. I won’t fear losing myself in my routines or in the anxiety of my stumbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep giving my all in every small event, every gesture, every written word, and every shared feeling. If everything goes wrong, I’ll learn. From mistakes, success is born—the opportunity to grow. The paths are many, and I am just one, but I’ll keep walking the path of the heart, following the will of my soul. If tomorrow isn’t what I hoped for, I won’t be afraid to go against the tide. In life, we are nothing without a bit of courage. In life, we are nothing without our hearts, which never stop loving one more time. Without the faith that lets us hold onto hope and believe enough to start over once again—and as many times as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I live. Tomorrow, if necessary, I’ll begin again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>i think i was born in the wrong generation</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/i-think-i-was-born-in-the-wrong-generation/i-think-i-was-born-in-the-wrong-generation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:00:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/i-think-i-was-born-in-the-wrong-generation/i-think-i-was-born-in-the-wrong-generation/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, lost in thoughts, I had numerous certainties that I was born in the wrong generation. That I possess values ignored by many of the people I interact with today. And so, I live more and more the conflict of feeling even lonelier, even though I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by people who trivialize what I do not see as acceptable. Yes, I am also a romantic, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to see a problem in that. Yes, I miss when the little things were valued, and I have the right to reproduce and believe in what I think is important but is absent in our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking, how crazy it must be, to send a letter to someone today and know that the reply will take time to arrive. And that the reply could come on a postcard with a picture, along with a lipstick mark, exhaling the scent of that perfume that intoxicates when you read it and gives that taste of presence. The truth is that, in that context, we knew the importance of waiting, the effort it takes to cultivate a relationship of friendship or love. We were aware of how hard everything was to achieve, and that’s why there was a greater sense of value. Today, some relationships begin and end, and people only really get to know the emoticons used, the preferred poses in social media photos, the way the person uses ellipses and hardly ever uses commas. But they knew little of the voice, little of the emotions, little of really looking into each other’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, many times, we catch ourselves measuring the attention the other gives us by how quickly they read and reply to our messages. And just the fact that this message isn’t answered is enough for war to be declared, for the confusion to be set. Because in the urgency we live, we no longer know how to wait. It’s the price we pay for living rushed days in our obligations, with virtual proximity and tremendous real distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my parents&amp;rsquo; time, in my grandparents&amp;rsquo; time, relationships really ended. Today, they barely start and often don&amp;rsquo;t end. And just like they started in some random chat conversation in an indifferent way, they end with a nice ignored message on WhatsApp, an unfollow on Twitter, and a thousand subtweets on Facebook. Today, people live the cowardice of ending a relationship via SMS and believe that a story can be so subtly interrupted, with some expressionless characters, with little explanation, without showing the certainty of their decisions. It’s awful to have to end something, but what’s the reason for ending it in such a selfish and impartial way? It’s always been hard to have that talk about “we need to talk.” But I still prefer to look into someone&amp;rsquo;s eyes, express my opinions, my dissatisfactions, hear the truth come out of their mouth, even if I don’t agree, but knowing how to respect it. And I think that is worth so much, but for many, it no longer means anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have the obligation to like someone, but we should have the obligation to respect, to put ourselves in the other’s shoes. But it’s sad how more and more no one respects, how there’s no concern for anything other than themselves. People live with a disrespect here and there and start to think it’s normal and become yet another to propagate something that should be totally unacceptable. We live in a generation full of spoiled people. People who increasingly run away from their responsibilities. Who only want the good side of life but panic when they find themselves in difficulties. People who are great at living for a night, but barely know how to live a month dedicated to someone. People who know exactly what to say to convince someone to live a few moments but don’t know what to do to keep someone truly by their side. They want to live life urgently, with the cliché discourse that one must be happy and unattached, raising the flag that all the pleasures of life must be lived. They think the ends justify the means, even if they have to deceive, use people, fake feelings, pretend to be someone they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone is about to do something for someone else, they should ask themselves: If it were me, how would I feel? Would I like it or hate it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is that people seem to be getting used to wanting a lot while giving little. They believe everything should be temporary, afraid of endings, of attachments. Afraid of when the laughter ends, when the table is no longer full, when there are no more jokes, no more good moments. And so they live with the other while there is something to gain, something to enjoy. As long as everything is good, as long as living is a good time. A mix of selfishness with a high dose of self-interest. I think this explains the full tables in bars and the empty rooms in hospital visits. This explains those who abandon us when we need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many, when reading this, may say that in our generation, despite these problems, everything has become easier. That now we don’t call on the phone or cell, but we use free internet calls and video conferences to do the same. But then I ask, how many actually do that? The overwhelming majority is content with words because they are easily manipulated. A lot can be said without worrying about the truth, without worrying about expressions, whether someone is laughing or not. Whether they’re crying or not. Look around. People are together, but they don’t let go of their phones. They are present, but more concerned with taking pictures to show off on social media. They waste time when they should be looking at each other, loving each other, enjoying the moment and the place, trying to find the best angle to photograph and show how special that moment is. But if it were really that special, they wouldn’t even have remembered to take a picture. When something is truly unforgettable, and we are busy enjoying it, we even forget to take many photos, because hearing the other’s voice, being present, kissing, hugging, enjoying is truly the most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, when we made a call, it cost us something. It was a sacrifice. Receiving a call and hearing that person’s “Hello” was worthy of a declaration of love. It was a proof that the person really missed us, cared, and felt the absence. Before, we knew handwriting, we spent a lot of time writing letters, and flirting was much more fun. There was that moment of observing, of exchanging glances. The other person was truly a mystery to us. We didn’t know their tastes because we hadn’t stalked them on Facebook beforehand. Starting a conversation was a bit intriguing, but it was more exciting because it was in person, without many pretenses. And to meet new people, we had to force ourselves to step out of our comfort zone and face the world. Today, the charm of a true conquest has been lost. Because it has already started to become rare in many cases. In other words, today everything is easily won but also easily discarded. We live in programmed obsolescence among ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, people declare much more of what they want, and because of that, there’s no longer much conversation, just a little willingness from both, enough to do something at that moment. Today, we have apps to get a relationship. We choose people as if they were objects in a store window. We are throwing away our inner values and fighting more and more to improve our exterior, because in such superficial relationships, we don’t have time to show anything else. What matters is always improving beauty, camouflaging age, and cultivating a few preferences and qualities as worn-out as saying you’re a perfectionist in a job interview. And right there, we set up a date, exchange a few words, and what used to take much longer and was more valued is now achieved very quickly and is less appreciated. It doesn’t matter with whom, as long as in the end, we can have the most pleasure. In the end, the night must have been worth it, so we can throw away our tension. It comes, it happens, it goes, and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we continue living as singles, but under the illusion that we are never alone. We settle for little when inside we truly want much more, we want a lot. But we go on with life, accepting crumbs out of fear of loneliness. But maybe what no one has realized is that despite our choices, in the future, beauty will be gone, people will be even more used to discarding, not valuing, only cultivating the superficial. Our destiny will be quite cruel because we will see ourselves as objects that are thrown away and that no one wants anymore. Because what remained in us, which should have been so important, was taught by us to be trivialized. And we will indeed be in complete loneliness. Still single, but we will no longer live the illusion of being alone, we will be definitely abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with so much use of technology, we are becoming less real people, living virtual realities. We think that in life, everything must happen almost at the speed of light, at the speed of an email or a WhatsApp message. We speed things up so much, lost in a rush with no reason, when we should begin to relearn to live moments more calmly. Relearn how important it is to value and have others, to have a friendship, a love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that love relationships today last less because we are always rushing to live everything we can as soon as possible. And they end because, obviously, everything happens so fast that it loses its charm. And today, we don&amp;rsquo;t try to fix anything. At the first flaw or disappointment, the person goes and calls the next person in line. We no longer make any effort because before we see if it&amp;rsquo;s worth it, we give ourselves completely, recklessly, disregarding our self-respect. And when someone feels entitled to slow down, often the other doesn’t understand and rushes to live other stories that allow them to enjoy what is being denied at that moment. But is that really important? Does it need to be like this? And those who use the pretext of trying to fill the gaps in a relationship, resorting to cheating? Funny how those who cheat often don&amp;rsquo;t want to be cheated on. In other words, they want everything for themselves and nothing for others. And we keep losing ourselves in our desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many continue like this, always justifying the urgencies, everything is an emergency. The urgency is to live. But what is really living? How far do we need to go in this relentless search to only live what is good? And how long will we live without knowing the value of life’s simplicity in the small moments? In the great efforts? When will we realize that life is not only pleasure, not only sex, and life is far from being this colorful world that people post about? When will we realize that we are losing ourselves in our freedoms? When will we learn that technology helps us get closer, but physical proximity cannot be neglected? We must not stop looking into each other’s eyes. We must embrace our evolutions without devaluing what should never have gone out of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that people keep realizing that a smile is worth more than a “=D”. That a declaration of love made in person, a hug, some sincere words, are worth more than a “S2” or a “&amp;lt;3”. I hope people don’t replace the lovely sound of the other’s laughter with a fake “hahahaha”. We need to be close virtually, but even closer for a handshake. What we are on the outside is important, but what we have on the inside is far more impressive. Before hurting the other, before using each other, discarding people like objects, we should never forget that inside each one of us beats a heart, that despite being hurt and disbelieved, only waits for the moment when it will truly be loved for who it truly is. That we don’t just want a message that is read and answered, we want to be seen and reciprocated. That we keep living our fast-paced lives, very committed, but knowing how to appreciate the sweet taste of waiting, lived without fear. That we learn to prune the freedoms that can distance us from ourselves. Life was made to be, not to have. May we never lose ourselves in our daydreams, may we never stop being who we truly are. We cannot let ourselves be imprisoned by the reckless freedom of others. We deserve love, we deserve more calm, more respect. We deserve to live more slowly. Those in a hurry can pass by; ahead, we will all be in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two blog posts in the same week… this is the first time this has happened - maybe this is cool or good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe everyone here must know what depression is, right? Well, if you don’t know, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=depression&amp;#43;mood&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and read more about it… Well, what probably some people don’t know is that there is chronic depression, meaning no matter how much you try to improve, change, take medication, find hobbies, or whatever the attempt may be; you will die with depression. And I’ve had it since I was 16, but I’m not going to tell you my age, right (I’m in my 20s, lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have tried to kill myself, but I was saved by a guy who is a great friend, and at the time, I went to live at his house, to be away from everything and everyone, with my phone turned off, just studying 5/6 hours a day, creating random physical projects, and working… this somehow helped me, and I kept going with life, but in the last 2/3 months, I tried to kill myself twice again and there’s something I need to say; it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing many people think about those who kill themselves, especially due to depression, is that the person died because they were very sad or because they were very upset, but the greatest pain they felt was when they tried to kill themselves, because it is a very painful process… you try to hurt yourself more and more, feeling the pain you are causing yourself. If you think about it, when a person hurts another with words, physical or psychological pain, the one who hurt did it, even at the moment, they didn’t feel the pain, but hurting yourself, getting weaker and weaker, feeling unbearable pain, is something you really need to have strength for or go as far as your strength can take you and… well, the rest you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that yesterday I was with my mind in the clouds and I thought of a phrase that made total sense in my head, which would be “I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end,” followed by “I’m not a bad person, I just made bad choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe these phrases make sense to you in various ways - or maybe not, but they made sense to me. I really don’t want to die, I just want all this pain to end. Even saying this scares me. It scares me because many people may not realize it, but when you are hurting yourself, people who like you (if they really like you) are also hurt, and just like you - or me -, they also get exhausted, sad, and cry because of the accumulation of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said everything I’ve said so far, there’s a phrase my psychologist told me that still sticks in my head, which is “sometimes I don’t know why you seek me out, Yuri” and continued with “you can read people, understand and comprehend the best and worst in them, like a Rubik’s cube, which I’ve seen you solve in less than 60 seconds,” and concluded with “but you can’t understand what’s going on inside you, and you also exclude me and exclude other people who are trying to help you”… she’s not wrong, I really can understand people based on their body language, and even in conversation, and this must be one of the reasons why many people like to have serious conversations with me, but when it comes to understanding what I feel based on the origin of my depression, I simply go blind, lose my way, and everything seems to make no sense… and the worst part is, I can’t bring this to people, even those who are close, and, of course, there’s a reason for this, and the reason is that when I tried to open up to people besides the great friend mentioned earlier, basically almost everyone disappeared, avoided me, or changed the subject as if what I felt was superficial. So, someone who was already closed off became even more closed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say that I can handle my loneliness, but if I could, I wouldn’t have tried to do so much crap to myself, right? Right. But thinking about it, years have passed since this recent suicide attempt, so I’m probably managing/mediating/balancing my depression. Maybe it’s not ideal, but it’s a big progress, and every small step should be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And… As I reflect on my journey, I realize that every day is a battle, but it’s also an opportunity. An opportunity to find moments of joy, to connect with others, and to discover new strengths within myself. It’s not easy, and there are days when the darkness feels overwhelming, but I’ve learned that it’s okay to ask for help and to lean on those who care about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has helped me immensely is finding a creative outlet. Whether it’s contributing to open-source projects, coding, setting up servers, or writing, expressing myself through these activities has been a powerful way to process my emotions and to find a sense of peace. It’s a reminder that even in the midst of pain, there is beauty to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also started taking long walks without a specific destination, just wandering aimlessly. These walks, accompanied by music, have become a form of meditation for me. They help me clear my mind and feel more grounded. It’s a small but significant step towards healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important lesson I’ve learned is the value of self-compassion. It’s easy to be hard on myself, to feel guilty for my struggles, and to believe that I’m not worthy of love and support. But I’ve come to understand that being kind to myself is crucial. I deserve the same compassion and understanding that I would offer to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone reading this who may be going through a similar experience, I want you to know that you are not alone. Your pain is real, and it’s valid, but so is your strength. It’s okay to have bad days, and it’s okay to reach out for help. There is no shame in seeking support, whether it’s from friends, family, or a mental health professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that healing is not a linear process. There will be ups and downs, but every step forward, no matter how small, is progress. Celebrate your victories, no matter how minor they may seem, and be gentle with yourself on the tough days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I want to leave you with a quote that has resonated with me: “The wound is the place where the Light enters you.” - Rumi. It’s a reminder that even in our darkest moments, there is hope and the possibility of healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can help others feel less alone and more understood. Together or alone, we can find the strength to keep moving forward, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I just wanted to share this outburst and leave this incredible phrase that I said before, but I will repeat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something I would like to say, which is a simple but sincere thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I come here to Bear, I always search for my name or the link to my blog (the one you are reading now), and I always see amazing posts about views or ideas that are divergent or similar to mine, and they are all incredible reads!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank you &lt;a href=&#34;https://zoeloukia.bearblog.dev/were-just-as-wonderful-as-we-always-were&#34;&gt;Zoeloukia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pj.bearblog.dev/it-doesnt-have-to-be-one-or-the-other&#34;&gt;PJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rimarin.bearblog.dev/links&#34;&gt;Rimarin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://anton.earth/social-media-crisis&#34;&gt;Anton&lt;/a&gt;, and my favorite bear-girl, &lt;a href=&#34;https://coco-fraise.bearblog.dev/on-having-outgrown-a-city&#34;&gt;Coco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>reflections on solitude and superficiality</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/reflections-on-solitude-and-superficiality/reflections-on-solitude-and-superficiality/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:21:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/reflections-on-solitude-and-superficiality/reflections-on-solitude-and-superficiality/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the conversation, reading what you wrote, and responding… It seems bizarre, but it’s not social “burnout” or lack of social “battery,” I just don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it’s normal to see me disappear out of nowhere and then reappear after days, weeks, months, or years, randomly, and if you ask me why, my answer will be a simple “yes” or “because I want to,” and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see a reason to explain to people the reason for my actions, as long as that action doesn’t directly have something to do with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, changing the subject but still within the new topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I mentioned that I left social media but left a personal bot forging and replicating posts I make elsewhere, like Telegram, and of course, I knew some people would end up messaging me on social media, but I simply said “fuck it, I don’t need to care about that,” and that’s what I did. But this week I logged into the social media where my bot was active, and the worst-case scenario happened: I was flooded with messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bizarre that even without interacting with other people, they try to interact with me… You might think this is something only a “jerk” would do, but do you really think I care what people think about other people who post on social media like Instagram and Facebook? Seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people cut out the parts they hate most about themselves to try to reach the standard of other people and then be happy because of likes on photos… Imagine needing others to validate what, how, or who you are. How bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superficiality is in fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let’s talk more about what I’ve been doing in recent months, but to summarize, it would be: nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, nothing… The only thing I’ve really been doing is gaining weight, programming small things, setting up new personal servers, and trying to reach a level of perfect solitude to be happier with my solitude than I already am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yuri, why do you want to reach a level of happiness being solitary?” Because people are strange to me, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to get romantically involved with two girls in the last three months, and I remembered why I don’t try to get involved even as friends, let alone romantically… People have become so superficial and uncultured that they simply can’t understand what is good and what is bad, just as they can’t have a dialogue to solve the problems you/you are having and/or want to try to take/use/spend your money, as if you were the provider of that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a guy with old-fashioned culture, so yes, my worldview is more closed… I’m the kind of guy I usually call myself “Man Guy,” because I’m going to act like one; inside and outside the house, I’m going to play my role as a man… I’m the kind of guy with the culture of the old folks from the 20s/30s/40s, and I always make that very clear to the girls I end up getting involved with, and I’m also from the Right State (in case it’s different in your country, I’m part of the “conservatives”) and that already says a lot about most of the things you should imagine about who I am, but it’s worth saying that I’m conservative, but I respect your choices and opinions, as long as you don’t involve me in them and don’t try to impose them on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, I will provide everything for the girl who is with me, as long as she behaves like a woman who respects herself as such. You can’t demand something if you have nothing to offer, or if you have nothing equivalent to what you demand. This is one of the problems of society at the current romantic level, but another problem is when you are arguing/discussing and/or having many problems, and one of the parties keeps talking for a relevant amount of time about the problems they are having, what is wrong and saying to talk and solve, but the other party simply doesn’t want to have the dialogue… This ends any relationship, no matter the level or degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are friends and don’t talk about the differences you have, at some point, by refusing the premise so much, you will end up fighting and cutting off the friendship, and the same happens for romantic relationships… It’s no wonder that more and more I envy my grandfather who is also my father… He took care of my grandmother, never drank, never smoked, never disrespected her, always protected and provided everything she and the house needed, without questioning, without looking at other women and always focused on just getting and having a single woman who is his wife (my grandmother), just as I envy the woman my grandmother was and who was also my mother, for the woman she was/is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m tired and fed up with all levels of relationships, from passerby to friendship or romantic; shallow people, with shallow opinions, with shallow conversations and idiocies they created for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today what I’m looking for is social distancing from all people… On a professional level, I keep the conversation only about the work environment, without putting my life in it, just as I only listen and forget what they say about personal life…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the subject again, I have increasingly embraced my unique and exclusive solitude because I feel good when I simply open my eyes and everything is calm, just as I feel good when I simply lie down and see everything calm too, and that my biggest concern is doing my job, eating and the rest is whatever I want, and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? Try solitude, peace, and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much more to say here… Actually, I wanted this to have just a few lines, but it’s already too long; I just wanted to say that I’m fine, living well, and continuing in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>reflections on the fear of failure and seeking recognition</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/reflections-on-the-fear-of-failure-and-seeking-recognition/reflections-on-the-fear-of-failure-and-seeking-recognition/</link>

      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/reflections-on-the-fear-of-failure-and-seeking-recognition/reflections-on-the-fear-of-failure-and-seeking-recognition/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve already failed?), seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a very hardworking person&amp;hellip; I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m failing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things. Recently, I became unemployed because I lost my freelance contracts with companies, and on the same day my last contract ended, I took all my savings and paid off what I could, but I still had debts. Like most people, I found myself thinking, &amp;ldquo;What am I going to do now?&amp;rdquo; along with &amp;ldquo;How do I solve this?&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; And then my mind went into a spiral of &amp;ldquo;I failed, I&amp;rsquo;m failing more and more,&amp;rdquo; combined with the infamous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m worthless&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m a piece of crap/useless, and my life is over.&amp;rdquo; I believe many people think similarly when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all these negative things, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to continue my life and activities with a more positive mindset. Even though some days, even sleeping is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been sending my resume to various companies and enrolling in those extremely tedious and exhausting application processes, like those on Gupy and LinkedIn, where you have to click on a job, open an external link (in most cases), and go to a site where you have to create a new account, redo the entire registration process, answer questions you&amp;rsquo;ve already answered, and submit a resume you&amp;rsquo;ve already sent&amp;hellip; Ugh, how annoying. But the pinnacle of it all was receiving two emails from different companies saying I was &amp;ldquo;too good for the job.&amp;rdquo; No, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t said in those words, but using part of their response, I was &amp;ldquo;overqualified&amp;rdquo; for the position. Yes, that was part of the reply in both responses. That&amp;rsquo;s when I found myself thinking about the following problem: you get frustrated when you&amp;rsquo;re not qualified, so you study more to become qualified, then if you study too much, you become overqualified&amp;hellip; Can you understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No qualification -&amp;gt; Rejected for knowing too little -&amp;gt; Study to become qualified -&amp;gt; Rejected for knowing too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t understand this logic or neurosis. But let&amp;rsquo;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still talking about finding a job, nowadays, it seems values have been inverted. I&amp;rsquo;ve always strived to know more, not leave work for others, or not do a half-baked job, but I know people who just live drunk, going out all the time, and missing work with fake and fraudulent excuses. They don&amp;rsquo;t put in the effort, know less than I do about the subject or profession, but are well-regarded, get raises or promotions, while people like me who work hard are left unnoticed. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &amp;rsquo;90s, it&amp;rsquo;s been increasingly difficult to achieve anything. Houses are much more expensive, as are cars and the cost of living, so we get frustrated because it feels like we&amp;rsquo;ll never achieve anything of our own, while any idiot/liar achieves things without any merit or deserving. How bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the fear of failure, and things seeming to get worse, I still want to think positively. But is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying, working, deserving, achieving, focusing, sacrificing, and various other things seem increasingly distant, no matter how much effort you put in. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s like my friend said, &amp;ldquo;Bad luck in luck, and luck in bad luck.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in the philosophy that &amp;ldquo;you create your own opportunities,&amp;rdquo; but each passing day, it seems to prove false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Seriously, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I&amp;rsquo;m confused. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to think about this without thinking that I&amp;rsquo;m the one who failed, in the same sense that it seems people can&amp;rsquo;t recognize a genuine and correct person. Or maybe, what people can see are those who know how to lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do most people nowadays believe those who lie better instead of those who show the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is talking better than demonstrating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is lying better than being truthful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is having no value better than being a person of value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying. One day at a time. One step at a time, without overreaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I can still prove to myself that I am good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made it through the day. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you. Seriously, I&amp;rsquo;m so proud of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to look forward to anything when you&amp;rsquo;re feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you&amp;rsquo;ll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always tell myself, &amp;ldquo;Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll feel better. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll be alright.&amp;rdquo; Remember, that &amp;ldquo;someday&amp;rdquo; comes one day at a time, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get there. You will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you come back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>reflections of a conflicted impostor</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/reflections-of-a-conflicted-impostor/reflections-of-a-conflicted-impostor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 21:31:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/reflections-of-a-conflicted-impostor/reflections-of-a-conflicted-impostor/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah&amp;hellip; how difficult it is to admit this, but I failed. Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s difficult, if I&amp;rsquo;m afraid, or if I just lack courage, despite many people saying that fear is the absence of courage, so this might be redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor&amp;hellip; I remember setting up LANs for acquaintances or friends to play games, and even setting up a server (more like hosting in this case) at home, so people could create their own game servers, websites, emails, and various programs&amp;hellip; I did so many things that were, well, let&amp;rsquo;s say &amp;ldquo;ahead of my time.&amp;rdquo; Talking like this, I even seem old, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not over 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue, in itself, is that I miserably failed to become someone better or maybe even to be someone.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how I failed, much less where I failed professionally, because, seriously, I have two degrees, over 90 courses (which I paid for), including at Harvard, Cisco, and even Microsoft certifications, but still, professionally, I feel that I failed and continue to fail, even going through trial and error. And when it comes to being a person, on a personal level, I also failed, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how and I don&amp;rsquo;t know where, but I miserably failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost one of my three friends, I currently check my phone about 3-4 times a day, and totaling that time, I don&amp;rsquo;t exceed about one to two hours a day on my phone (excluding when I&amp;rsquo;m out or traveling, in which case screen time usually exceeds eight hours since I watch anime). And I can&amp;rsquo;t feel good about myself today, I can&amp;rsquo;t have a romantic relationship with any girl, not because I&amp;rsquo;m not attracted to any, but because I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have the desire to talk to someone in that sense. I can&amp;rsquo;t simply like most of my family, mainly due to their attitudes, which I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with. Besides, I consider family to be people who are with me, who share moments with me, or who simply create bonds, not people who share part of my DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe my solitude and loneliness have brought me this feeling? I doubt it.
My solitude and loneliness are things I chose and am happy with in most cases, and my indifference to things that don&amp;rsquo;t affect me is also something I feel good about. Actually, these or this is the only point where I feel good and accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this seems like an endless confusion. A crazy paradigm or paradox.
My professional failure, in which I dedicate and have dedicated a lot, building a name in the technology field, participating in various open and even some closed projects. Building a GitHub portfolio that has surpassed six thousand followers. My personal failure, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that I enjoy my solitude, loneliness, and indifference to most problems. However&amp;hellip; where are these failures? Where exactly did I go wrong? Where can&amp;rsquo;t I recognize the error, or why do I believe there is a failure? What kind of mental confusion is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, my psychologist said that I suffer from impostor syndrome: I think I&amp;rsquo;m bad at everything, that I don&amp;rsquo;t do anything well or good, and that I failed miserably at everything, but actually, I&amp;rsquo;m fine and doing well, but I deceive and lie to myself saying the opposite. But honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I can&amp;rsquo;t see or understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe my chronic depression is causing this? Even if it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat stable? Or is it because I grew up hearing from my biological parents that I was a shame and should have died? Even hearing from my adoptive parents that I was a pride and the best they could have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the subject a bit but still within it, sometimes I cry at night and don&amp;rsquo;t even seem like the same person during the day or in front of others.
When I&amp;rsquo;m out with my headphones on, listening to a song I really like, I dance alone and even sway if I don&amp;rsquo;t dance. I smile when I see something I find cool or a person who has an enjoyable conversation, and look, even people who don&amp;rsquo;t agree with me but know how to have a debate make me smile because we are human beings with different cultures, ideas, or views, but who can still have a conversation with debate without attacking the other. I also laugh, even chuckle, when I see something funny. And all this on the street, but most of the time, my mind is thinking about how I managed to fail in every aspect of my life and how I&amp;rsquo;m a despicable person, while at the same time thinking I&amp;rsquo;m an awesome guy, and hearing from others how intelligent I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, am I a flawed, confused, silly, good, intelligent guy, or a bit of everything? Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Navigating contradictions in life</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/navigating-contradictions-in-life/navigating-contradictions-in-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 15:40:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/navigating-contradictions-in-life/navigating-contradictions-in-life/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the jumble of thoughts and emotions that make up my existence, I find myself entangled in a web of contradictions. It&amp;rsquo;s not poetic; it&amp;rsquo;s real, raw, and sometimes messy. Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth about living as a paradox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to happiness, sure, but I can&amp;rsquo;t shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there&amp;rsquo;s a begrudging respect for the person I&amp;rsquo;ve become, scars and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s not because I&amp;rsquo;m indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It&amp;rsquo;s just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It&amp;rsquo;s like I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just not used to being seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m great at keeping other people&amp;rsquo;s secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I&amp;rsquo;d rather keep them locked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m a walking contradiction. It&amp;rsquo;s messy, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing, but it&amp;rsquo;s real. And maybe that&amp;rsquo;s okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life&amp;rsquo;s contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, buddy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You did it! Another day and another week! Another one conquered.
You should be proud of yourself. Seriously.
I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you.
I know you have a lot going on. I know there&amp;rsquo;s a lot weighing on your shoulders. You have a lot on your chest. Don&amp;rsquo;t stop. You can&amp;rsquo;t give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve come too far, man. Your heart is a warrior! You&amp;rsquo;re stronger than you think. You&amp;rsquo;ve overcome all those other bad days. And I know those days all blend together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday feels like today and tomorrow will feel like yesterday. That&amp;rsquo;s just kinda how things go. There&amp;rsquo;s only one thing you can do, you have to change tomorrow. You have to be better than you were today and don&amp;rsquo;t forget your future needs you. Your past doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re going to be okay. I know you will. You always are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you can smile today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll always be here. I&amp;rsquo;ll always be proud of you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I was born in the wrong generation</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/i-was-born-in-the-wrong-generation/i-was-born-in-the-wrong-generation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think many people must have already read about how much I enjoy being alone, and for me, in a general context, it&amp;rsquo;s okay, but I admit and confess: I wish I had someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, lately, during my aimless walks or in those moments when you start to ponder about life, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how much I wish I had someone close to me. And when I say close, I mean a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had become a sort of consensus that I would die alone, and when I say die alone, I mean without friends and a girl with whom I would or should share my life. Not that I see an extremely big problem here, but because, as I said, it was already a consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from my uncle that I would die like him, without friends, with a certain significant amount of money in the bank, but sad and happy at the same time. And the worst part is that I had already accepted that. I had really told myself many times, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to die alone and it&amp;rsquo;s okay,&amp;rdquo; and I really had in mind that it was okay. However, nowadays, despite it being okay and my acceptance of it, I really wish I had someone&amp;hellip; But for me, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely difficult to have or find someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a very logical guy and not very sentimental. I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend or lie, I speak the truth straightforwardly, without beating around the bush. I don&amp;rsquo;t measure the words I&amp;rsquo;m going to say; there&amp;rsquo;s no softening of the facts. I&amp;rsquo;m also a guy with old moral values, so much so that there&amp;rsquo;s a phrase I really like that says, &amp;ldquo;Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong decade. I have principles that have been lost and love things that are no longer valued,&amp;rdquo; and this is not even close to being a joke in good or bad taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I possess values ignored by many of the people I interact with today. And so I increasingly live with the conflict of feeling even more alone, even though I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by people who trivialize what I don&amp;rsquo;t see as acceptable. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m also a romantic dude, and I don&amp;rsquo;t see a problem with that. Yes, I miss when the little things were valued, and I have the right to reproduce and believe in what I find important but absent in our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about how crazy it would be to send a letter today to someone and know that the response will take a while to arrive. And that the response could come on a postcard with a photo along with a lipstick mark and the scent of that perfume that intoxicates as you read and gives that taste of presence. The truth is that we knew the importance of waiting, the effort it takes to cultivate a friendship or love relationship. We were aware of how difficult everything was to achieve, and so there was a greater sense of value. Today, some relationships begin and end, and people only got to know well the emojis used, the preferred poses in social media photos, the way the person uses ellipses and almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t use commas. But they hardly knew the voice, hardly knew the emotions, hardly really looked into each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, many times, we find ourselves measuring the attention the other gives us by how quickly they view and respond to our messages. And if that message isn&amp;rsquo;t answered, the war is declared, the confusion is armed. Because in the urgency we live in, we no longer know how to wait. It&amp;rsquo;s the price we pay for living hurried days in our obligations, with virtual closeness and tremendous real distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my parents&amp;rsquo; and grandparents&amp;rsquo; time, relationships actually ended. Today, they barely begin and often don&amp;rsquo;t end. And just as it started in any casual chat, it ends with a nice ignore on WhatsApp, an unfollow on Twitter, and a thousand indirects on Instagram. Today, people live the cowardice of ending a relationship by SMS/WhatsApp and believe that a story can be subtly interrupted in a few characterless characters without much explanation, without showing the certainty of their decisions. It is indeed horrible to have to end something, but what&amp;rsquo;s the reason for ending something so selfish and impartially? Discussing the relationship and the whole &amp;ldquo;we need to talk&amp;rdquo; thing has always been difficult. But I still prefer to look into each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes, express my opinions, my dissatisfaction, hear the truth coming out of the person&amp;rsquo;s mouth, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t agree but knowing how to respect. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s worth so much, but for many, it no longer means anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s sad how more and more nobody respects each other; there&amp;rsquo;s no concern for anything beyond themselves. People live disrespecting one thing here and another there and begin to think it&amp;rsquo;s normal and become one more to spread something that should be totally unacceptable. We live in a generation full of spoiled people. People who increasingly shirk their responsibilities. Who only want the good side of life but despair when they find themselves in difficulties. People who are great at living for one night but hardly know how to live for a month dedicated to someone. People who know very well what to say to convince someone to live some moments but don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do to truly keep someone by their side. They want to live life urgently, with the tired speech that one must be happy and detached, waving the flag that one must experience all the pleasures of life. They believe the ends justify the means, even if they have to deceive, use people, pretend feelings, pretend to be someone they&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone was going to do something for another, they should ask themselves: If it were me, how would I feel? Would I like it or hate it? Yes, you know I&amp;rsquo;m indifferent about most things, but what I&amp;rsquo;ve explained and many may not have understood, realized, or let pass is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have antipathy; I just do my best not to create or get involved in others&amp;rsquo; problems that are not directly related to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is that people seem to be getting used to wanting a lot while giving little. They believe everything should be temporary out of fear of outcomes, of attachments. Fear when the laughter ends, the table is no longer full, when there are no more jokes or good times. And so they live with each other as long as there&amp;rsquo;s something to gain, to enjoy. As long as everything is good, as long as living is a good time. A mixture of selfishness with a high dose of interest. I think this explains the crowded bars and the empty rooms during hospital visits. This explains who abandons us when we need them the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many, when reading this, may say that in our generation, despite these problems, everything has become easier. That now we don&amp;rsquo;t call by phone or cell, but we use free internet calls and video conferences to do the same. But then I ask, how many really do that? The overwhelming majority content themselves with words because they are easily manipulable. Much can be said without caring about the truth, without caring about expressions, if they&amp;rsquo;re laughing or not. If they&amp;rsquo;re crying or not. Look around. People are together but glued to their cell phones. They&amp;rsquo;re present but more concerned with taking photos to show off on social media. They waste the time they should be looking at each other, loving each other, enjoying the moment and the place, trying to find the best position to photograph and show how specialthat moment is. But if it truly were special, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even think of capturing it. When something is truly unforgettable and we&amp;rsquo;re busy enjoying it, we often forget to take many photos because listening to the other&amp;rsquo;s voice, being present, kissing, hugging, enjoying is indeed the most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, to make a call, we had the cost of calling, it was a sacrifice. Receiving the call and hearing the &amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo; from that loved one was worthy of a declaration of love. It was really a proof that the person really missed us, cared, missed us. Before, we knew each other&amp;rsquo;s handwriting, we spent a long time writing letters, flirting was much more fun. There was that moment of observing, exchanging glances. The other person was truly a mystery to us. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know their tastes well because we hadn&amp;rsquo;t stalked them on Instagram or Twitter/X before. Starting a conversation was somewhat intriguing, but it was more exciting because it was done in person, without much fuss. And to meet new people, we had to force ourselves out of our comfort zone and go out there to face the music. Today, the charm of a real conquest has been lost. Because it often starts to become quite rare. In other words, today everything is easily conquered, but also very easily discarded. We live in a programmed obsolescence among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today people declare much more what they want, and because of that, there&amp;rsquo;s not much conversation anymore, but just a little willingness from both, enough to do something at that moment. Today we have apps to get into a relationship. We choose people as if we were objects in a shop window. We&amp;rsquo;re throwing away our inner values and fighting more and more to improve our exterior because in such superficial relationships, we don&amp;rsquo;t have time to show anything else. What matters is always improving our beauty, camouflaging our age, and cultivating a few preferences and qualities as cliché as saying that we&amp;rsquo;re perfectionists in a job interview. And right there we arrange a date, exchange a few words, and what used to take much longer and was more valued is now achieved very quickly and undervalued. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter with whom, as long as in the end, we can have the maximum pleasure. That in the end, the night was worth it, to let off steam. Arrive, do it, make it happen, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we keep living single, but in the illusion that we&amp;rsquo;re never alone. We content ourselves with little when inside, we want much more, we want a lot. But we go on with life, accepting crumbs out of fear of loneliness. But perhaps what no one has noticed is that despite our choices, in the future beauty will have gone away, people will be even more accustomed to discarding, not valuing, only cultivating the superficial. Our destiny will be quite cruel because we&amp;rsquo;ll see ourselves really as objects thrown away and that no one else wants. Because what remained in us, which should have been so important, was taught by ourselves to be trivialized. And yes, we&amp;rsquo;ll be in complete loneliness. Still single, but we won&amp;rsquo;t live in the illusion of being alone anymore; we&amp;rsquo;ll be definitively abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the face of so much use of technology, we&amp;rsquo;re becoming less real people, living virtual realities. We think that in life, everything must happen almost at the speed of light, at the speed of an email or a message through WhatsApp. We&amp;rsquo;re accelerating things so much, lost in a hurry without any reason, when we should start relearning to live the moments more calmly. Relearn how important it is to value and have the other, have a friendship, a love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that romantic relationships today last less because we&amp;rsquo;re always racing off to experience everything as soon as possible. And they end because, obviously, everything happens so fast that it loses its charm. And today we don&amp;rsquo;t try to fix anything, at the first defect or disappointment found, the person goes and calls the next in line of interested ones. We no longer make an effort for anything because before we see if it&amp;rsquo;s real, we already surrender body and soul, with total recklessness in front of our self-love. And when someone feels entitled to go slower, many times the other doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand, and finds themselves in a hurry to go live other stories that allow them to enjoy what is currently denied. But is that really important? Does it need to be like this? And what about those who use the pretext of trying to fill in the gaps of the relationship, resorting to betrayal? It&amp;rsquo;s funny that people who cheat often don&amp;rsquo;t want to be cheated on. In other words, they want everything for themselves and nothing for others. And we&amp;rsquo;re increasingly losing ourselves in our desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many go on like this, always justifying urgencies; everything is an emergency. The urgency is to live. But what does it really mean to live? Until when do we have to keep going in this frantic search to live only what&amp;rsquo;s good? And when will we realize the value of the simplicity of life in the small moments? In the great efforts? When will we realize that life is not just pleasure, not just sex, and life is far from being this colorful world that people post about? When will we realize that we&amp;rsquo;re losing ourselves in our freedoms? When will we learn that technologies help us to get closer, but physical proximity cannot be neglected? We must not stop looking into each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes. We have to enjoy our advancements without devaluing what should never have gone out of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope people continue to realize that a smile is worth more than a &amp;ldquo;=D&amp;rdquo;. That a declaration of love made in person, a hug, sincere words, are worth more than a “&amp;lt;3” or a &amp;ldquo;S2&amp;rdquo;. I hope people don&amp;rsquo;t replace the pleasant sound of the other&amp;rsquo;s laughter with a fake &amp;ldquo;hahahaha&amp;rdquo; too much. We have to be close virtually, but even closer for a handshake. What we are on the outside is important, but what we have on the inside is much more impressive. Before hurting others, before using each other, discarding people like objects, we should never forget that inside each of us, there is a heart that, despite being hurt and disbelieved, only waits for the moment when it will truly be loved for who it really is. We don&amp;rsquo;t just want a message viewed and responded to; we want to be seen and reciprocated. Let us continue living our lives hurriedly, very committed, but knowing how to value the sweet taste of waiting, lived without fear. May we learn to prune the freedoms that can distance us from ourselves. Life was made to be and not to have. Let&amp;rsquo;s never lose ourselves in our daydreams, let&amp;rsquo;s never stop being who we really are. We must not let ourselves be trapped by the other&amp;rsquo;s reckless freedom. We deserve love, we deserve more calmness, more respect. We deserve to live slower. Whoever is in a hurry can go ahead; in the end, we&amp;rsquo;ll all be in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, indeed, I&amp;rsquo;m in the wrong generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll end it here.
Take care. Love each other. And I hope you find that person who will love you and be with you until the end of your life, and every time you look at each other, your eyes shine mutually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I&amp;rsquo;ll end with the following closing and greeting:
With love, Yuri.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work, Travel, Cultures &amp; Decisions</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/work-travel-cultures-decisions/work-travel-cultures-decisions/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 18:20:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/work-travel-cultures-decisions/work-travel-cultures-decisions/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I had several ideas about what to post, but none of them seemed reasonable enough to share here, and as you know, this blog doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a posting &amp;ldquo;schedule&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; I post when I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some people know, I design, set up, and maintain databases, which is just my main job. There&amp;rsquo;s also the fact that I set up servers, from hardware to cabling and configurations - and there are smaller gigs like freelance website development and volunteering as a math and artificial intelligence teacher for children. So, I end up traveling for various jobs, and currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Canada, Japan, China, the United States, and France. Sometimes, during these trips, I end up extending my stay in the country (nothing that would expire my visa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, every time I extend my time in the countries I visit, I end up using the right part (brain analytics) and observing the details of each culture, and the more I see, the happier I am to know new cultures, and I use this to improve myself. And, I believe the coolest culture I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered was the Japanese, and I say this in a general life context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese, in their majority, have a culture of striving to be better, giving their best, and not disrespecting people. That&amp;rsquo;s something I find really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very rare to see a Japanese person doing something to bring shame upon themselves or their close ones, and when I say close ones, I mean friends, family, and even professional hierarchy. Even politicians who steal usually commit seppuku (suicide) for having brought shame to their own family name. It&amp;rsquo;s sad but highly courageous, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japan, for the most part, you see boys trying to have a considerably more comfortable and stable life so that they have the ability to start and maintain a family. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the issue of girls, who for the most part, try to minimize exposure of their bodies both virtually and physically (no, they don&amp;rsquo;t wear sweatshirts when they go to the beach in the summer), the way they learn to sit in the seiza style (although it can be somewhat painful), and how they behave in general in front of people, like giving themselves respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything is rosy, but their culture manages to be better than all the others in my opinion (and certainly much better than the current one in my country, Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to see, within their own home, you use soft slippers only indoors, and when you go to someone else&amp;rsquo;s house, known or not, if you enter it, you can&amp;rsquo;t just walk in with your shoes on&amp;hellip; they will give you one of those soft slippers they keep for visitors to use. Another extremely strong point is that you don&amp;rsquo;t see Japanese people coming into your home and going after you, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;hellip; first, you&amp;rsquo;re invited in, and then, after being invited, your limit is the person&amp;rsquo;s living room, but that&amp;rsquo;s the extent of how far you go, meaning they won&amp;rsquo;t go and wander around your house, and now comes another cool point: you/they cannot sit without the resident&amp;rsquo;s permission. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that cool? They come to your house, you sit down, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;dozo&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;go ahead&amp;rdquo;), they&amp;rsquo;ll stand because without your permission, it becomes disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowing to someone and/or when apologizing is cool&amp;hellip; you show that you made a mistake, and in your mistake, you were disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling someone by their family name, in respect to them and their family, is another thing that I consider incredibly amazing, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for my flawed Japanese (which I&amp;rsquo;m already studying and will be my fourth language), I would try for a resident visa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe another culture that I find interesting is Canada&amp;rsquo;s, where you can see French and English (British-French with a bit of American) traits, so much so that you can see places like Quebec, where they mix French with English, but that will be (with a big maybe) for another post here on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the subject, moving away from work, travel, and cultures, lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try new things, like getting on Tinder to meet someone interesting - and what I can say sincerely about it is that if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something carnal/casual/sexual, you can go ahead without fear because you&amp;rsquo;ll find plenty. There was a time between 2017 and 2021 when Tinder was good, its design was more traditional (rustic and exotic), and you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay to have a friendly/nice experience on it, but now, most of the reports I&amp;rsquo;ve heard say that you &amp;ldquo;need&amp;rdquo; to pay, otherwise, you won&amp;rsquo;t get matches, won&amp;rsquo;t be seen by other people, and a bunch of other things&amp;hellip; I personally haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this &amp;ldquo;free-paid&amp;rdquo; Tinder because I have a partnership with them, so I have a monthly code renewed with gold for free&amp;hellip; in a week on Tinder, I had an average of 200 matches, and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not a handsome guy, actually, according to a survey (and there was one), with 25 consulted girls, on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being horrible and 10 being a dream guy), I got 8.25, which is a high average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tinder, I would select the people I liked the most by their bio (yes, I read all the bios), and those who didn&amp;rsquo;t have one or only put their Instagram username, I would select based on visual appeal. And what you might say is &amp;ldquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s hypocritical,&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it is, because I don&amp;rsquo;t buy clothes that don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me visually (although most are black or dark blue and plain). But, honestly, most people there were too superficial. When I saw someone saying they liked &amp;ldquo;Game of Thrones&amp;rdquo; books, I would ask or mention something about &amp;ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire,&amp;rdquo; the person didn&amp;rsquo;t even know which book it was. Or when they were fans of hardware or big geeks, and the person only talked to me about a super-fast computer or Naruto and that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;hellip; mediocre subject, with the person most of the time not leaving space for a question or continuation of the conversation. But, for me, the worst people were the ones who, in the first message, would send you their phone number, or Instagram username, and then add &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t come here much&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; so I deleted the account. Besides, Tinder&amp;rsquo;s guidelines say you can&amp;rsquo;t put your Instagram in the bio, in fact, it mentions that you can&amp;rsquo;t put any form of external contact in your profile (I even reported some for this), and there were people selling packs, like onlyfans directly in the bio, or who would message you asking for your number or Instagram username, so when they call you, they&amp;rsquo;d start with a generic message, followed by an image with the prices of nude packs&amp;hellip; sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I really wanted to have a girlfriend, start a serious relationship and develop that, but at the height of my 19/20 years, that desire died directly, and I kept that idea calmly until a friend said &amp;ldquo;try again, it&amp;rsquo;s worth it,&amp;rdquo; so I listened to my best friend, just to refute his thesis with something recent&amp;hellip; I chose Tinder because I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of this &amp;ldquo;menu for intercourse/coitus&amp;rdquo;, and I refuted him. But he didn&amp;rsquo;t accept it, so I started going out with friends to social events, and I met eight girls, six of them wanted only sexual/casual relationships, and two wanted only a &amp;ldquo;friend with benefits&amp;rdquo;, so I avoided them. Once again, as a trained physicist that I am, I presented my thesis to him, and then he accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not the type to succumb to this kind of &amp;ldquo;peer pressure&amp;rdquo; because I only have three friends, and we three are what I can call &amp;ldquo;unethical,&amp;rdquo; we reject many of the standards that society imposes nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I went back to my MGTOW (men going their own way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been in MGTOW since I was 19/20 years old, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel a lack or need to be with someone daily&amp;hellip; of course, I sometimes miss cuddling, but I don&amp;rsquo;t miss (missing and longing are different things, research), but when I think that nowadays, everyone is hooking up with everyone, and that people don&amp;rsquo;t have any culture anymore, even though they&amp;rsquo;re educated (culture and education are different things, research, but, in short, culture is how you behave, education is your educational ability, like reading and writing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another decision I made was to treat people outside my circle with complete indifference, like, before, I still tried to treat people I was talking to as a possible person I would have in my life in the future, nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided not to do that anymore, it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting, and although it might not seem different, but when you&amp;rsquo;re someone I consider from my circle (and even a large part of my family isn&amp;rsquo;t), I&amp;rsquo;m completely different&amp;hellip; I randomly text, send some cool articles, invite you to go out on the weekend, to travel with me, send you gifts, and even text as if I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to write anymore, all stupidly, and even send you photos like a goofball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, closing this article/post, what I&amp;rsquo;ve decided most recently is that I won&amp;rsquo;t do any more experiments that will require me to try to find someone to share life with&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll comfortably stay in my MGTOW &amp;amp; my eternal solitude, and finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll adhere to a relationship solely and exclusively casual/carnal/sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One month after leaving the internet and leaving everyone believing I&#39;m still active</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 21:15:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/one-month-after-leaving-the-internet-and-leaving-everyone-believing-im-still-active/one-month-after-leaving-the-internet-and-leaving-everyone-believing-im-still-active/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been&amp;hellip;a month since I left social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said in my previous post that I would delete my social media accounts, but then I did something better: I activated my AIs, my bots, and automated my posts. So, sometimes I post something through my private bot on Telegram. It formats and adds things using Tailwind patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bot sees some posts, likes others, and does what I used to do but have no desire to do anymore: look at what other people are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I feel off social media?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I feel great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would go through a social media detox, but it seems that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even necessary. I don&amp;rsquo;t open Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat to see if anyone sent me something, much less do I check from time to time if someone posted something new, whether it&amp;rsquo;s someone I&amp;rsquo;m following or someone I like to see (like Yetz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m much better than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solitude and mindfulness practices have improved significantly. My phone usage has decreased from 1.5 to 2 hours to just 25 to 30 minutes. This has been incredibly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, my daily activities consist of listening to music on my headphones, responding to messages from my few friends, and occasionally checking Tinder to see what&amp;rsquo;s up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exception to my phone usage meter is my Kindle. I don&amp;rsquo;t see the need to own a separate Kindle e-book reader. When I&amp;rsquo;m out and about, if I&amp;rsquo;m not reading a physical book or an e-book on my phone, I&amp;rsquo;m playing games on my PSP (PlayStation Portable), especially on long trips or when I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting gears slightly, but staying on the topic, I&amp;rsquo;m much happier and more at peace with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends used to call me a &amp;ldquo;weird nerd,&amp;rdquo; not in a derogatory sense, but because I have a resting &amp;ldquo;bad boy&amp;rdquo; face and always seem angry or like I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk to anyone. In reality, I&amp;rsquo;m just a nerdy guy who loves manga, books, anime, and technology. To top it off, I&amp;rsquo;m low-key and rarely post anything on the internet (my bot does it for me). I only view things I&amp;rsquo;m tagged or mentioned in, which is quite often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of my solitude. I only post things that have already happened in my life, so many of my posts are recycled. My AI-powered bot learned this and now replicates it, which makes some people think I&amp;rsquo;m out having fun with friends when I&amp;rsquo;m actually just reading a book, chatting with friends on Discord, or playing games on my computer, PlayStation, or PSP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I go for a morning walk or run, complete my work tasks, and read something. I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &amp;ldquo;The Hedge Knight&amp;rdquo; by George R.R. Martin, which is set in the same world as &amp;ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&amp;rdquo; (the Game of Thrones series), but the story takes place before that time period. When I&amp;rsquo;m not reading, I enjoy taking leisurely walks or runs of 10-15 kilometers around my city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of my random walks around, I found one or two people who were sad and I made them smile, but the point is, I usually make people think a lot about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this week, I met a girl walking, and I was walking in the same direction, but I was walking fast, so I was faster than her. When I stopped at the crosswalk, I noticed with my peripheral vision that she was looking at me, so I looked at her, smiled, and she smiled back. I took out my headphones and said, &amp;ldquo;Every day I like to make someone smile, after all, a day without smiles is a day wasted.&amp;rdquo; She laughed and said that day was not a wasted day. I laughed lovingly at that phrase and told her to take care, put my headphones back on and started walking again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way I found a St. Bernard dog (the same name as my city) and I always thought this breed was wonderful, so I had to stop to pet the dog. I thanked the owner for letting me pet the dog and continued on my way. After that I arrived at the Green Area square (the people in my city gave this nickname to the square, but it has another name). I bought an acai, sat on an isolated wooden bench, and listened to some Post Malone songs, while watching people walking, running or exercising, and said to myself &amp;ldquo;if I was wasting my time on social networks, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to have smiled as much as I smiled today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, each day has been wonderful and unique, even if I do repetitive things, these things end up becoming unique because of something that happens while I&amp;rsquo;m doing that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the craziest part of this is that I am doing many things without losing my solitude. I never looked for validation on social media, just as I never cared if people stopped talking to me. Seriously, I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of guy that most girls would be angry with, because if I send you a message and you ignore me on purpose, I don&amp;rsquo;t care. If I send you a message and you don&amp;rsquo;t answer me for days, I won&amp;rsquo;t send another message asking for attention, time or an answer. I always answer whenever I pick up my cell phone, so if you take a minute or ten days to answer me, when I pick up my cell phone or open Telegram or WhatsApp on my computer, I will answer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people think that my way of being is because I don&amp;rsquo;t care, and that&amp;rsquo;s not quite right. Although I love my solitude, if I have a relationship with you, whether friendly or romantic, and you take a long time to show up, I will call to see if you are okay. If you don&amp;rsquo;t answer, I will send you a text message or a message through an app. The problem is that it takes time for you to become my friend, but when that happens, you become part of my lived routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between when you are just a person who talks to me and when you become at least a person with a relationship that I consider a friendship. And probably the biggest difference is that I will show and talk much more than if you weren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, speaking of this blog, it is my day-to-day or what I like to call my &amp;ldquo;time-to-time&amp;rdquo;, because I post here when I believe there will be a post, and it is not linear, quite the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, today I will end this post here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remember that you can send me an email or call me on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My last goodbye</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/my-last-goodbye/my-last-goodbye/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 09:15:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/my-last-goodbye/my-last-goodbye/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this era defined by relentless connectivity, I stand at the crossroads of an extraordinary digital transformation, contemplating a pivotal decision that will redefine my relationship with the virtual realm. Today signifies the commencement of a profound chapter—the deliberate erasure of my social media footprint. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and various other platforms that once dictated my online existence are now on the brink of extinction in my digital universe. In this odyssey, I&amp;rsquo;m not merely bidding farewell to virtual connections; I&amp;rsquo;m dismantling the intricate web of automation that once orchestrated my online narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: my Instagram, once a meticulously curated gallery of automated reposts imitating the influencer Yetz, is now dissipating into the vast digital abyss. The seamless replication of Yetz&amp;rsquo;s Instagram stories, orchestrated by bots and AI, is gracefully coming to a halt. This departure signifies more than just a retreat from artificial glamour; it marks a profound shift from the borrowed shine of someone else&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inner circle, ever adaptive, has already transitioned to alternative communication platforms such as Signal, Session, or Telegram to stay connected. Nevertheless, the impending solitude prompts a self-imposed digital retreat. My phone, now permanently set in &amp;lsquo;Do Not Disturb&amp;rsquo; mode and cloaked in grayscale, imposes strict limits on the time allocated to each application—a mere 25 minutes per day. Farewell, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat; a new chapter begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to sever ties with social media is deeply rooted in a profound realization: the reasons to disconnect far outweigh those compelling me to stay linked. The tipping point was a seemingly idyllic Instagram post showcasing a picturesque sunset, concealing the underlying truth of that moment—I was battling subtle depression, hungry and cold. Why did I feel the need to showcase a facade of perfection when authenticity was my true essence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aid in this transformative endeavor, I&amp;rsquo;ve armed myself with an arsenal of tools and strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-my-computer&#34;&gt;On my computer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News Feed Eradicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction-free YouTube extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-my-phone&#34;&gt;On my phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grayscale display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airplane mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus modes, particularly &amp;lsquo;Do Not Disturb&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App-specific time limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-cultivating-healthy-habits&#34;&gt;In cultivating healthy habits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation heightens self-awareness, curbing impulsive behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading replaces mindless scrolling, enhancing attention span.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Musical instruments and sports fill the void with gratifying activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;various-lifestyle-changes&#34;&gt;Various lifestyle changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A physical alarm clock keeps my phone in a separate room, deterring late-night or early-morning digital temptations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;lsquo;dumb&amp;rsquo; watch replaces my Fitbit, reducing dependency on constant notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A notebook and pen capture fleeting thoughts, replacing digital clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kindle or physical books offer an escape from the digital world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letter writing with envelopes and stamps resurrects the charm of traditional correspondence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venturing outside, I intentionally leave my phone behind or stow it away in a bag. The more I distance myself, the more I realize how little I truly need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of disconnection, I find solace in silence—a sanctuary away from the curated noise of social media. This intentional withdrawal is a quest to rediscover authenticity, rebuild meaningful connections, and savor the beauty of life without the digital filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the days unfold in my journey of digital emancipation, the void left by the absence of constant notifications and virtual validations begins to fill with a profound sense of clarity. The quiet moments, once drowned out by the incessant buzz of likes and comments, now echo with the subtle melody of my own thoughts. The deliberate steps I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to minimize my digital presence are slowly transforming into a dance of liberation, a choreography of rediscovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each passing sunrise, I witness the world with unfiltered eyes, unencumbered by the virtual lens that once colored my perceptions. The hues of the sky, the rustle of leaves, and the laughter of strangers in a coffee shop all become more vibrant, more authentic, as if the world has shed its pixelated veil. This newfound clarity extends beyond the physical realm, penetrating the depths of my relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin to appreciate the genuine conversations that flourish without the constant interruption of notification pings. The richness of a shared moment, unmarred by the compulsion to document it for online consumption, adds a layer of authenticity to my interactions. As I delve into the art of letter writing, the tactile pleasure of putting pen to paper becomes a sensory experience, replacing the sterile tap of a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital detox seeps into my professional life, too, as I reevaluate the meaning of productivity in a world perpetually connected. The once incessant urge to check emails and respond to Slack messages is replaced by a deliberate focus on deep work. My creative pursuits, once overshadowed by the instant gratification of social media engagement, now unfold in the quiet sanctuary of concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the process of disconnecting is not without its challenges. The reflex to reach for my phone in idle moments, seeking the instant distraction of a digital scroll, remains a persistent echo of my former self. However, armed with resilience, I redirect that impulse towards more mindful activities – a few pages of a captivating novel, a stroll in the park, or a moment of quiet reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of curated perfection in my virtual life accentuates the beauty of imperfection in the real world. I embrace the candid snapshots of life, acknowledging the rawness of emotions and the unpredictability of experiences. The flaws and vulnerabilities once concealed behind filters now stand proudly, adding depth to the tapestry of my existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I navigate this uncharted territory, I find myself becoming an unintentional advocate for a life less digitally adorned. Friends and acquaintances, initially perplexed by my decision, begin to witness the transformative effects. Some join me in the pursuit of mindful disconnection, while others observe from a distance, curious about the path less traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quietude of this digital detox, I forge a deeper connection with myself. The introspective moments that were once fleeting now become a constant companion. In the absence of external validations, I discover an internal compass guiding me towards authenticity and self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each passing chapter of this narrative, the decision to sever ties with the digital mirage emerges as a pivotal turning point. The canvas of my life, once crowded with pixelated imitations, now awaits the strokes of genuine experiences and unfiltered emotions. The odyssey continues, and as I navigate the uncharted waters of a life less connected, I realize that in disconnecting from the virtual noise, I&amp;rsquo;m uncovering the symphony of my true self.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embracing Feelings Amidst Indifference</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/embracing-feelings-indifference/embracing-feelings-indifference/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 18:40:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/embracing-feelings-indifference/embracing-feelings-indifference/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the seasons changed and time marched on, my unique approach to life continued to shape my interactions. I found solace in the simplicity of my indifference, but it also became a dividing line between me and those who struggled to comprehend my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I found myself at the center of an unexpected situation that tested the limits of my apathy. A colleague, Maria, approached me with tears in her eyes. She had just experienced a devastating breakup and sought comfort in the presence of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yuri,&amp;rdquo; she whispered, her voice trembling, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. He left me, and I feel like my world is falling apart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced at her, my expression unmoved. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that I lacked empathy; it was simply that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fathom investing emotional energy in the melodrama of someone else&amp;rsquo;s failed relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maria,&amp;rdquo; I replied calmly, &amp;ldquo;breakups are tough, but life goes on. You&amp;rsquo;ll get through this, just like countless others have. Don&amp;rsquo;t let a failed relationship define your happiness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tearful eyes met mine, searching for a glimmer of understanding. Finding none, she shook her head in disbelief. &amp;ldquo;Yuri, I thought you were my friend. How can you be so cold?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed, recognizing that not everyone could appreciate the simplicity of my indifference. &amp;ldquo;Maria, I can be your friend, but I won&amp;rsquo;t indulge in unnecessary emotional turmoil. If you need practical advice or a distraction, I&amp;rsquo;m here. But I won&amp;rsquo;t wallow in your emotions with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Maria walked away, her disappointment lingered in the air. It was a reminder that my approach to relationships was a double-edged sword—one that cut through unnecessary drama but also left others wounded by the absence of expected empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst the ebb and flow of my unconventional interactions, I found a surprising ally in an acquaintance named James. He, too, had embraced a similar philosophy of detachment, finding comfort in the simplicity of not caring about societal expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James and I often sat in the park, observing the world with a shared sense of detachment. We laughed at the trivialities that consumed the lives of those around us—people stressing over inconsequential matters, societal norms dictating behavior, and the relentless pursuit of validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, Yuri,&amp;rdquo; James said with a chuckle, &amp;ldquo;not caring is liberating. We&amp;rsquo;re free from the chains that bind others, the need to conform and fit into molds that society creates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded in agreement, appreciating the camaraderie in our shared indifference. In a world where everyone seemed to be chasing after something, James and I found contentment in the pursuit of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Evolution of Indifference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years passed, I noticed a subtle evolution in my attitude toward indifference. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t merely a shield against the trivialities of life; it became a guiding principle for navigating the complexities of relationships and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Emily, a fellow enthusiast of solitude and introspection. Our connection was built on shared silences, comfortable in the absence of unnecessary words. Together, we explored the beauty of nonchalance, weaving a tapestry of understanding that transcended the need for constant validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily and I chose a life less ordinary, free from the burdens of societal expectations. We traveled to distant lands, explored the depths of our passions, and reveled in the simplicity of just being. Our bond thrived in the space between words, where actions spoke louder than empty promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, even in the sanctuary of our shared indifference, challenges arose. Emily faced a critical decision regarding her career, torn between the expectations of her family and the pursuit of her true passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yuri,&amp;rdquo; she confided in me, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to succumb to the pressures and expectations, but the weight of familial obligations is suffocating.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gazed into her eyes, acknowledging the gravity of her dilemma. In that moment, I realized that my indifference had evolved into a source of strength, a foundation upon which genuine connections could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Emily,&amp;rdquo; I said with a sincerity that transcended my usual bluntness, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t let the expectations of others dictate your path. You have the power to shape your destiny. If they truly care about you, they&amp;rsquo;ll understand. If not, their opinions shouldn&amp;rsquo;t weigh you down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She nodded, a glimmer of determination in her eyes. Emily embraced the power of indifference, not as a shield against the world but as a catalyst for personal growth and authentic connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ripple Effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of my journey through the landscape of indifference, I began to notice a ripple effect in the lives of those around me. Some embraced the concept, finding liberation in shedding the unnecessary baggage of societal expectations. Others recoiled, unable to grasp the nuances of a life unburdened by the need for constant validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close friend, Daniel, approached me one day with a perplexed expression. &amp;ldquo;Yuri, I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching how you navigate life with this indifference, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wrap my head around it. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it get lonely?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckled, realizing that my path wasn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. &amp;ldquo;Daniel, indifference isn&amp;rsquo;t about loneliness; it&amp;rsquo;s about freedom. I choose my connections wisely, investing in relationships that matter rather than spreading myself thin trying to please everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s a conscious choice, not a result of isolation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Daniel mulled over my words, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but reflect on the journey that led me to this point. Indifference, once a shield against the noise of the world, had become a guiding principle—a philosophy that shaped not only my life but the lives of those willing to explore its depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand tapestry of existence, my story unfolded as a testament to the power of embracing one&amp;rsquo;s true self. It was a narrative of authenticity, resilience, and the unyielding pursuit of a life well-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, as I penned the final words of my tale, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but marvel at the intricate dance of indifference that had propelled me forward. In a world saturated with noise, I had found harmony in the simplicity of not caring about most things, allowing the symphony of my existence to play on, unhindered and true to its unique melody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the pages of my diary of indifference, there were still unwritten chapters, nuances that challenged the apparent coldness of my philosophy. Despite the aura of detachment permeating my existence, I was not immune to the emotional echoes reverberating in the trenches of my being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a serene night, as the stars drew constellations in the sky, a nostalgic melody echoed in the air. It was a song that awakened memories buried beneath the layers of my indifference. I felt a twinge of longing, a distant echo of feelings I had carefully stored away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a message from someone from the past, someone who once shared laughter and secrets with me. Their words were an invitation to reminisce about times the clock had forgotten. I accepted the invitation, not due to a sudden wave of emotion, but out of curiosity to explore the forgotten corners of my own heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meeting was like a journey through time, a dive into the deep waters of memory. We laughed at old jokes, revisited places that were once silent witnesses to our joys and sorrows. Although I remained true to my philosophy of indifference, a gentle flame of nostalgia burned beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst shared stories and meaningful glances, I realized that my indifference did not make me immune to the beauty of lived moments. There was still room for appreciating the subtleties of life, for the warmth of a rekindled friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I presented myself as an architect of indifference, shaping my world with straight lines of rationality, the truth lay in the complexity of emotions pulsating within me. I was, after all, human. A man with a heart that, though guarded by layers of indifference, still vibrated to the touch of genuine emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience did not fundamentally alter my approach to life, but it left an indelible mark. There were still fragments of sensitivity that, even under the armor of indifference, pulsated with a unique resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, with the renewed knowledge that my journey through indifference had not turned me into an imperturbable statue, I continued to walk the paths of life. With each step, I acknowledged the duality of my existence: the pursuit of clarity through indifference and the constant reminder that, even in pages written with the ink of apathy, the heart still echoed its silent melodies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disconnected</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I currently find myself disinterested in consuming online content and engaging with online communities, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel bad at all. It was not spurred by anything negative I encountered; it just happened. It feels more like a phase I need right now or potentially permanently growing out of certain internet habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, Reddit, Tumblr, YouTube, Mastodon, Bluesky, or TikTok accounts. I usually come across funny memes or videos through friends who send them to me. I am on a few small, friends-only Discord servers that move slowly and don&amp;rsquo;t generate any fear of missing out, keeping me undistracted. Even then, I recently noticed I don&amp;rsquo;t care to properly look at the latest Tumblr post screenshot or meme and just move past it. When I check HackerNews or Tildes, I spend at most 5-10 minutes on them. Many times when I open those websites, I end up closing them almost immediately without clicking anything. The few YouTube channels I watch tend to upload about once a month, and I check them manually every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were times when I was excited about new communities popping up or discovering new niches of the internet, lurking on them or trying them out, especially around the small web. But right now, I feel comfortable being offline a lot, proceeding with my own little projects at my own pace, working on myself, and having a good time with people in real life. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pressured to keep my online identity up. My website has been reworked since October, but I no longer feel the need to do it as fast as possible or to have something flashy and new to present, like a finished project or progress in my learning. Everything is happening without the pressure to perform or put something online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I came across some other online communities and wondered if it was something worth engaging in, something to sign up for, check, and get to know, like I used to do. However, I embrace the digital reduction and partial digital solitude. I have already announced plans to step down from some community I spent a lot of time on to focus on other things in January. Instead, I will be more creative with my art, continue embroidery projects, study for my degree, read some books, meet new people, restart The Odin Project, and learn more Rust. I love the view of my laptop as this personal project machine that also has messages from my friends and some games, and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see others going through a similar thing, like a disillusionment with how they usually use the internet, which is amazing. I hope you all find the niche communities you crave and curate the RSS feed of your dreams. Mine is best left empty right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sometimes Humans Just Need to Sit in One Place and, Like, Hurt</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/sometimes-humans-just-need-to-sit-in-one-place-and-like-hurt/sometimes-humans-just-need-to-sit-in-one-place-and-like-hurt/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 01:15:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/sometimes-humans-just-need-to-sit-in-one-place-and-like-hurt/sometimes-humans-just-need-to-sit-in-one-place-and-like-hurt/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After writing about being in a creative slump, a few kind strangers generously offered helpful suggestions: schedule a time to write each day, keep a journal (private is fine), stay consistent. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to implement all of them, and even if I don&amp;rsquo;t succeed, it&amp;rsquo;s comforting to know I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in this. Thanks to everyone who wrote to me with suggestions! I truly appreciate them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across Julia Cameron&amp;rsquo;s Morning Pages journaling exercise, and it strikes me as the perfect way to maintain a journaling habit. I like not having a set prompt or restrictions that tell me what to or not to write. The hardest part for me now (other than actually sitting down and journaling) is finding paper that will tolerate my fountain pens without breaking the bank. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up flouting the &amp;rsquo;longhand&amp;rsquo; part of Julia&amp;rsquo;s exercise and doing it in a text editor like I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing at a set time each day has proven difficult for me to stick with. I made plans to call a friend abroad this Monday morning, and the call lasted almost three hours. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to blow through my morning writing window, but the conversation was engaging and gave me plenty to chew on, so I&amp;rsquo;d say it was a net positive for my writing, even if it hampered my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I talked to this particular friend was more than a year ago, so we spent most of our time catching up on major life events. I was surprised to learn that she&amp;rsquo;d also been cheated on by her (now former, thankfully) partner earlier this year (around when the same happened to me). As my heart ached with sympathy, I felt an odd sort of kinship arise within me for her. Being cheated on is a strange experience because there&amp;rsquo;s no amount of explanation that can convey what it feels like to someone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t been there, yet there&amp;rsquo;s not that much to say to people who have been there either. They already know what it feels like through their own experience anyway, and no words can do that sort of pain justice. It was incredibly validating to hear us both come to the same lessons from our months of recovery: of growth, forgiveness, and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the significant lessons we&amp;rsquo;ve both learned in our recovery process is that forgiveness is about recognizing that other people&amp;rsquo;s actions aren&amp;rsquo;t a reflection of who we are but who they are. Most people who cheat don&amp;rsquo;t set out to do something so terrible or hurtful (the road to hell is paved with good intentions, after all) but are just trying their best to cope with their fears, insecurities, and trauma. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this to absolve them of their wrongdoing, but I had to accept this before I could understand and, through that understanding, let go of my anger. You can start to feel sympathy for people in this way, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve done terrible things to you. As my friend quoted, &amp;ldquo;hurt people hurt people.&amp;rdquo; And that realization can be liberating, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the bitterness, pain, or anger dissipate immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a DFW quote that goes something like, sometimes human beings have to just sit in one place and, like, hurt, and my mind wanders to it whenever I think about what I went through this year. When I suffered from excruciating pain, I desperately wanted something to take it away: a friend, a therapist, a new city, at times even the very person who caused the pain in the first place. But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that will really make you feel better. Nobody can bear the pain for you; you just have to sit with it until it subsides. And it might take a long time, but it will get better eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for the wisdom pain has taught me this year, but I still miss the sort of youthful innocence I used to have (and still see in my friends who haven&amp;rsquo;t suffered the same fate). I&amp;rsquo;ll miss trusting by default, rather than needing to consciously decide to place my trust in someone, and I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m going to always have to choose to ignore certain hurtful voices in my head which were silent before but are now empowered by betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also chatted about the challenges of making new friends as an adult, especially in a foreign country/culture. I struggled with this when I was abroad and continue to struggle with it now, and we both commiserated over how rare it is to find someone that really clicks, &amp;ldquo;vibes,&amp;rdquo; or is &amp;ldquo;on the same wavelength&amp;rdquo; with us, however you put it. In my experience, it rarely has anything to do with shared interests (which is how people typically try to look for friends), and I can&amp;rsquo;t judge whether I&amp;rsquo;ll click with someone until I talk to them and spend time with them in person. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried for years to dissect the components of this compatibility, or what makes my conversations with some people light up where others sputter out, but it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly difficult for me to distill any useful insights. (I&amp;rsquo;m not an impartial observer, and observing things can cause them to act differently, kind of like a variation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say one of the (perhaps not so profound) observations I&amp;rsquo;ve made about my friends I love talking to is that they not only listen and understand what I tell them without too much effort, but also that they convey to me that they understand, ideally with their own subtle thought-provoking twist or spin. I do believe there are a good portion of people in this world who understand me but who can&amp;rsquo;t consistently demonstrate that they do (heck, I&amp;rsquo;ve met plenty of them myself), and in my experience conveying to me that you understand is almost as important (or just as much) as understanding me in the first place. (I also believe there are people who are the inverse of this, who can make me believe they understand me when they actually don&amp;rsquo;t. I try to stay away from these people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Enjoy this Venn diagram I made of this, not drawn to scale. I really like when people draw up cute little graphics to illustrate concepts.)

&lt;p&gt;Yours, Yuri Cunha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted my formal application to coach kids writing this morning after the recruiter got back to me. I felt a bit embarrassed submitting an analytical writing sample that I&amp;rsquo;d written when I was thirteen and a creative writing sample from not much later (gosh—my Rupi Kaur phase is not something I want to relive), and I&amp;rsquo;m still cringing about it hours later. But, like someone who wrote me yesterday said, this feeling is fine (even normal), and the &amp;ldquo;key is to not let it stop you from doing something entirely.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s no point in me deciding if my writing is good or not anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m better off letting them decide for themselves, and if they like my writing and decide to accept me, great! If they don&amp;rsquo;t, well, I still have my precious free time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Abandoned Social Media</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/why-i-abandoned-social-media/why-i-abandoned-social-media/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 14:40:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/why-i-abandoned-social-media/why-i-abandoned-social-media/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been five years since I started my first blog, or even 15/16 years if you count my Tumblr as a blog. It&amp;rsquo;s almost incredible, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed social media platforms come and go. Some have thrived for years, while others lost their appeal. However, the truth is that most of them are still here today, with the less famous ones being less frequently used. But I&amp;rsquo;m not here to determine which ones have more or less merit or to say which social network is better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered a more sensationalistic, yet realistic, title for this post: &amp;ldquo;Why Social Media Died for Me.&amp;rdquo; However, I decided against using that title as it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite resonate with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my late teens, I&amp;rsquo;ve been gradually distancing myself from social media. Surprisingly, I was once &amp;ldquo;famous&amp;rdquo; on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, boasting around 100,000 followers on each and 1,000 to 5,000 likes on a simple &amp;ldquo;hello.&amp;rdquo; But those periods of fame were short-lived for me because I would simply give away, sell, delete, or change my username, abandoning social networks at random. Why did I do this? It all came down to one thing: saturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I still receive numerous messages and notifications in my DMs today, I don&amp;rsquo;t read them. I don&amp;rsquo;t read them because I don&amp;rsquo;t use social media anymore, and I simply don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever watched the TV series &amp;ldquo;Mr. Robot,&amp;rdquo; in which Rami Malek portrays Elliot Alderson (you should watch it), he says in the first episode of the first season (Episode 1 - Season 1), &amp;ldquo;Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children? Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit; the world itself&amp;rsquo;s just one big hoax. Spamming each other with our burning commentary of bulls**t masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books make us happy but because we wanna be sedated. Because it&amp;rsquo;s painful not to pretend, because we&amp;rsquo;re cowards.&amp;rdquo; If you pause to analyze it for a moment, it aligns with what was said in the ninth episode of the first season (Episode 9 - Season 1): &amp;ldquo;Is any of it real? I mean, look at this. Look at it! A world built on fantasy! Synthetic emotions in the form of pills, psychological warfare in the form of advertising, mind-altering chemicals in the form of food, brainwashing seminars in the form of media, controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks.&amp;rdquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a genius to understand the basics: people spend their entire days on social media, pretending to be close to the people they interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms are increasingly eroding your privacy, sharing and disseminating everything you do, from the name of your device to your IP-based location. Most people accept this without even realizing what&amp;rsquo;s happening because they don&amp;rsquo;t read privacy policies or the cookies that are tracking them. Consequently, our screens are inundated with targeted advertisements collected through insane telemetry. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even the worst part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant issue is that everything has become artificial, and there&amp;rsquo;s no desire to have real, in-person interactions anymore. Nowadays, if someone wants to see you, they video call you. I can understand this if you live far away, but if you&amp;rsquo;re within a 15-30-minute drive, go and meet the person in real life. Companies in Brazil send messages via a messaging app called WhatsApp instead of calling, sending SMS/MMS, or emailing. This raises questions about the depth of these interactions and the invasion of privacy. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly provide your WhatsApp number or agree to communicate through it, who said you could be contacted using it? I once had WhatsApp, but I no longer do, and I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to have it. I use Telegram and Session, but even then, I only talk to a few people (around 15-20), and Telegram is sparsely used in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The craziest part of it all is that here, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have WhatsApp, you&amp;rsquo;re considered a &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; person (someone who is pretending or not genuine). The need for people to prove themselves is so great that they might stop talking to you if you don&amp;rsquo;t have WhatsApp or Instagram, even if you have SMS/MMS/Telegram/Session/calling/iMessage/Samsung Message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, one of the primary reasons I abandoned social media and &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; messaging platforms (I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen true E2E encryption, as claimed by Meta&amp;rsquo;s WhatsApp, which can access your conversations) is the lack of security and privacy. For instance, in cases where the government or individuals request conversations, the app may provide them, despite claiming that the conversations are end-to-end encrypted, as in the case of Meta&amp;rsquo;s services (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook). On the other hand, I stick with Session and Telegram because on numerous occasions, governments and individuals have requested chat logs that both parties don&amp;rsquo;t have and can&amp;rsquo;t provide since they don&amp;rsquo;t have access to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that nowadays, people are pretending to be close while industries are getting richer by selling you. After all, by basic logic, if you&amp;rsquo;re not paying for the product, you are the product. Aside from the dissemination of utterly meaningless content with no real substance or value that many people consume, I fail to see the reason behind it. We are part of a generation with easier and quicker access to articles, materials, and education, yet we manage to be one of the least intelligent generations to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude here. If you ever intend to get in touch with me, you can find me via email (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@yuricunha.com&#34;&gt;contact@yuricunha.com&lt;/a&gt;). I hope you enjoyed this post, and I&amp;rsquo;ll see you next time. Bye! 👋&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Unconventional Bonds of Friendship and Solitude</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/the-unconventional-bonds-of-friendship-and-solitude/the-unconventional-bonds-of-friendship-and-solitude/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 06:10:57 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/the-unconventional-bonds-of-friendship-and-solitude/the-unconventional-bonds-of-friendship-and-solitude/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure where or how to start this article, or even if I should call it an article, despite being a blog post&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of the morning today, I went out to smoke a cigarette, and as always, I found myself pondering about the things in my world. I call it my world because I don&amp;rsquo;t tend to encompass everything that happens in my life. If something isn&amp;rsquo;t directly related to me or doesn&amp;rsquo;t interfere with my life, I usually ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was smoking, I was thinking that, despite having few friends (three, to be precise – I didn&amp;rsquo;t even need to count), I am fortunate to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2022, it has become increasingly challenging to want to be alive or to want to do anything. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because I failed in some areas of my life where I aimed for success, or simply because I didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve what I wanted. But it&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;ve given up because in everything I failed at or didn&amp;rsquo;t do, I intend to try again or start over. After all, I already know where or how I went wrong; I just need to fix it or begin anew and do better/differently. The craziest part of all this is that every time something doesn&amp;rsquo;t go well or doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out, these three friends of mine have always been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a person who spends a lot of time with family or the like, partly because I barely talk to them or see them. I also don&amp;rsquo;t particularly enjoy family gatherings or celebratory occasions like birthdays and the like. And being an atheist, I don&amp;rsquo;t celebrate religious holidays either. Being an atheist, it seems that people see me as a bad guy, morally deficient, or completely wrong – it&amp;rsquo;s quite amusing, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after saying all this, there are things that just seem like madness, you know, like most people praising me too much, saying I&amp;rsquo;m very intelligent, knowledgeable in various subjects, and able to explain many things. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about intelligence; it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve taken so many courses (I&amp;rsquo;ve passed 100 – congratulations to me), read so many books (I don&amp;rsquo;t like ebooks), and seen so much that I simply learn/learned from it. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing, you know? It&amp;rsquo;s crazy to go to a place or even some social gathering (even if I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it) and see people&amp;rsquo;s eyes light up when they discuss a subject, and I start delving into the details, mentioning references and even showing where those references can be found. It&amp;rsquo;s simply rewarding. But the flip side of the coin also reveals itself because when the conversation ends or the person leaves, the lightness turns into heaviness or exhaustion, and my social battery is drained. Can you understand how insane that sounds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, switching topics a bit, one of the three friends I mentioned, in this case, Lucas, whom I&amp;rsquo;ve known for 11/12 years (a considerable amount of time), is someone I can have endless conversations with. We practically talk every day throughout all this time, and the craziest part is that Lucas is just like me. We don&amp;rsquo;t keep saying that we like each other, but we share various similar ideas, even if we have different views on the same subject. This guy has been by my side in some pretty grim moments of my life, maybe even some dark times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for another of my three friends, Vinicius (who is also my cousin), we don&amp;rsquo;t talk every day, but this guy saved me from certain suicide, which was one of the darkest periods in my life. I even spent some time at his place. I needed to be alone, quiet, and, at most, have a conversation with someone. Of course, while I was there, I also went out with friends for drinks and outings, but the coolest part of it all was coming back and seeing one of my three brothers there, with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now there&amp;rsquo;s the newest addition to my count of three friends, Vitor&amp;hellip; an amazing guy with crazy ideas (reminds me of myself), another person who saved me from various situations and saved me from myself. We&amp;rsquo;ve spent hours on Discord, sometimes falling asleep in a call, just chatting or discussing something completely random. Hahahahahah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t need the world&amp;rsquo;s approval, and I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid to speak honestly and directly to people. But with these guys, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit cautious. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of losing them in my life or if it&amp;rsquo;s a fear of not having them around anymore. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but it&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to look to the side and imagine my life without these crazy people. I have few friends, but they are quality friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning from one extreme to the other, whenever I stop to think (well, I think while being still, hehe), I reflect on how my blood family, who share my DNA, knows so little about me. I&amp;rsquo;ve done and am doing so many things that only one of my three best friends knows or that only I know. I could say, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the reason for this,&amp;rdquo; but I do know: I don&amp;rsquo;t want to share it with them. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to share my life with my family, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing it. I like being alone, being by myself. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why I spend almost 24/7 with my headphones on and mostly on my computer. I read, study, take my courses, earn my money, talk to my best friends, and then I can just be quiet. Most people seem to want someone around or feel that if they&amp;rsquo;re away from their family, they&amp;rsquo;ll go crazy or just not feel right. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way for me. If people don&amp;rsquo;t talk to me, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. If they do, that&amp;rsquo;s fine too. As I mentioned before, I don&amp;rsquo;t need approval or recognition. I like being this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ideas and thoughts that, because they&amp;rsquo;re not popular nowadays, most people think I&amp;rsquo;m radical. But they seem not to understand the difference between radical and what I want, just as they confuse indifference with apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when my mom (actually my grandmother, but I call her mom) passed away, and people started wondering who would attend the funeral, who would speak or not, who didn&amp;rsquo;t attend didn&amp;rsquo;t care, and so on. But I think differently because each person has their way of dealing with grief. Some take time to understand, some don&amp;rsquo;t want to accept, and some accept and move on, as in my case. But what people don&amp;rsquo;t understand is that we all feel the same, but because we&amp;rsquo;re more steadfast, we might end up crying alone, not in public. We are distant, and we like to be alone in these moments. When we see someone sad or crying, we hug the person or stay quiet because that&amp;rsquo;s how we like it, and we tend to think that people like it that way too, even though we know that the person usually likes company. In that moment, we stay away because they might not want it at that time, so we keep to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the general societal mistake or the popular thoughts is assuming that we don&amp;rsquo;t have feelings or don&amp;rsquo;t think about things, but we do. Some show it less, some show it more, and we have thoughts, usually more rational and logical than those who are openly suffering. But our difference is that our minds aren&amp;rsquo;t clouded and confused, or if they are, we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about how to organize and do things based on logic and reason, not feelings and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/i-dont-care/i-dont-care/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been like this. I was a shy kid with few friends. I preferred spending time alone, reading books, or playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got older, I realized I don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about what others think. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to pretend to be interested in things I&amp;rsquo;m not. I can just be myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying I&amp;rsquo;m completely indifferent to everyone. I have a few close friends and family members I deeply care about. But for the most part, I just don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t care about what people wear or what they do with their lives. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about the latest news or gossip. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people find my indifference off-putting, thinking I&amp;rsquo;m rude or arrogant. But I&amp;rsquo;m not. I&amp;rsquo;m just being honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to care about something I don&amp;rsquo;t. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste my time and energy on things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of Indifference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indifference has freed me from the expectations of others. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about what they think or want me to be. I can just be myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lets me focus on what&amp;rsquo;s important to me. I don&amp;rsquo;t waste time and energy on what doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I focus on my passions and my relationships with people I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s made me more resilient. I&amp;rsquo;m not easily bothered by setbacks or disappointments. I know life has ups and downs, and I don&amp;rsquo;t let the downs get me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat in the park, and Sarah approached me with a weary look, like a shipwrecked sailor seeking salvation. She unleashed a torrent of complaints about her life – her toxic relationship, her soul-sucking job, and her endlessly problematic family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She rambled on, spilling her guts, hoping for some kind words, a pat on the back, or a sprinkle of sympathy. But as she finally took a breath, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sugarcoat the apathy that coursed through my veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sarah,&amp;rdquo; I said bluntly, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve been moaning about this for ages. Frankly, I&amp;rsquo;m tired of hearing the same sob story. If you&amp;rsquo;re so miserable, why don&amp;rsquo;t you just do something about it? I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered with your drama.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widened in disbelief, and her hopes shattered like glass. She had expected compassion, but what she got was a harsh dose of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yuri,&amp;rdquo; she stammered, &amp;ldquo;I thought you&amp;rsquo;d at least pretend to care. You&amp;rsquo;re so heartless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged indifferently. &amp;ldquo;Pretending is not my style, Sarah. You&amp;rsquo;re stuck in a self-imposed mess, and my patience is wearing thin. You&amp;rsquo;re the one who needs to decide whether you want to keep wallowing in self-pity or actually do something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah left, crushed and flabbergasted, and I was left to my own thoughts. Sometimes, the truth is bitter medicine, and not everyone can swallow it without choking. But in a world where I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about most things, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to sugarcoat reality, even if it meant sacrificing a friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Sarah stormed off, I remained seated, unfazed by her exit. I&amp;rsquo;d done what I believed was right. Indifference had its virtues, but it also had its harsh edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, Sarah contacted me again. She had taken some time to digest our conversation, and perhaps a hint of realization had seeped in. She seemed more composed this time, her expectations seemingly adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yuri,&amp;rdquo; she began cautiously, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about what you said, and it stung. But I can&amp;rsquo;t help but admit that you might be onto something. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck in this rut for too long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t mince words. &amp;ldquo;Sarah, I had to be brutally honest because you were stuck in a never-ending cycle of complaints without taking action. If you&amp;rsquo;re finally realizing that, then it&amp;rsquo;s a step in the right direction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She nodded, acknowledging my point. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t blame you for being straightforward. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to make some changes, for real this time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave her a curt nod. &amp;ldquo;Good. Remember, I don&amp;rsquo;t care about your complaints, but I do care about you. If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to change, I&amp;rsquo;m here to support you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah&amp;rsquo;s face displayed a mix of determination and resignation. She had learned the hard way that complaining wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to change her circumstances. It was up to her to make a choice: remain in the same rut or take action to create a better life. My indifference had served as a stark reminder that, sometimes, the most valuable advice is the one we don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after my candid conversation with Sarah, another incident occurred that highlighted my unique perspective on empathy. It was my cousin, Alex, who approached me this time. I could tell he was trying to choose his words carefully, and I braced myself for what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yuri,&amp;rdquo; Alex began, &amp;ldquo;I know we&amp;rsquo;re family, but I need to tell you something. Our distant relative, Aunt Margot, passed away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared at him blankly, my indifference apparent. Aunt Margot was someone I&amp;rsquo;d never met, had no connection with, and certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t care about. She was just a distant figure in the family tree, someone I had no reason to mourn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex mustered a weak smile, as if trying to appeal to some hidden well of empathy within me. &amp;ldquo;I thought you should know because, well, we are related.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, unapologetically blunt. &amp;ldquo;Alex, I appreciate you letting me know, but I have no emotional connection to Aunt Margot. We may share some distant bloodline, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m going to pretend to grieve for someone I never knew.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex&amp;rsquo;s smile faded, replaced by an awkward silence. He had probably expected some form of sympathy, even from a distant relative, but he was met with my cold and unapologetic indifference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could sense the unease in the air as Alex realized that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to play the part of the grieving family member. In a world where I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about most things or most people, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fake emotions or empathy for someone I had no connection to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with People Who Don&amp;rsquo;t Understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people find my indifference off-putting, thinking I&amp;rsquo;m rude or arrogant. But I&amp;rsquo;m not. I&amp;rsquo;m just being honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to be patient and understanding with those who don&amp;rsquo;t get it. I explain I care about them but not most things. I respect their opinions, even if I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone&amp;rsquo;s rude or disrespectful because of my indifference, I walk away. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for negative, judgmental people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Be Indifferent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be more indifferent, here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify what you care about.&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on what&amp;rsquo;s truly important to you, and let go of the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t compare yourself to others.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone is different, with unique goals and values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept that you can&amp;rsquo;t control everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on what&amp;rsquo;s within your control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let go of expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; Expectations lead to disappointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice mindfulness.&lt;/strong&gt; Stay in the present without judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take things personally.&lt;/strong&gt; Most people aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to hurt you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t dwell on the past.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s over, and you can&amp;rsquo;t change it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the future.&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on the present and live in the now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, indifference doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean apathy. You can be indifferent to some things and passionate about others. It&amp;rsquo;s challenging but worthwhile in the long run, leading to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice to Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you struggle with indifference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay not to care about everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what matters to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let others&amp;rsquo; opinions bother you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be yourself, not who others want you to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t waste time and energy on what doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Confessing my Stupidity</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/confessing-my-stupidity/confessing-my-stupidity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/confessing-my-stupidity/confessing-my-stupidity/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;confessing-my-stupidity&#34;&gt;Confessing my Stupidity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, time to spill the beans. This confession has been building up for a while, and now that I&amp;rsquo;m a full-fledged adult juggling a job and bills, there&amp;rsquo;s no avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it goes: I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with a friend who admitted to putting off embracing her true self, and it got me thinking. This feeling has been lurking around since I was a kid. Everyone around me was hitting the books, and hey, I lucked out too and got to do the same. But there&amp;rsquo;s been this gap that&amp;rsquo;s become more pronounced as we&amp;rsquo;ve all grown up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by these amazing folks—smart, insightful individuals. People who&amp;rsquo;ve got something to say. People who&amp;rsquo;ve dived into books and come up with specialized knowledge. Folks who understand their crafts and can put things together. People who aren&amp;rsquo;t just capable of skimming the surface but can really get a grip on a situation or topic. And then they take the time to break it down for me. I love it when my pals chat about world events and make connections. Their excitement is infectious, and I relish listening to them. I appreciate those who write or make videos about what they know, so I can unabashedly try to pick up a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, let&amp;rsquo;s come clean: my noggin is seriously lacking. There&amp;rsquo;s no groundbreaking or original thoughts™ happening up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna hear something funny? I&amp;rsquo;ve got a subscription to a money-focused and politics-focused newspaper, all in an attempt to get a better grip on reality like my buddies. I wanted to join the conversation, add something to it. Can you guess what happened? I&amp;rsquo;m clueless when it comes to stuff like inflation, stocks, or geopolitics. But don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I won&amp;rsquo;t stop reading. I&amp;rsquo;m a reading enthusiast, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain kind of throws in the towel when it comes to understanding. I can read, but it&amp;rsquo;s like the knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite stick; I can listen, but the bigger picture doesn&amp;rsquo;t click. Opinions? Nope. Conclusions? Not my strong suit. Head? Basically empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy elevator music plays in the background as my brain takes its owner (aka &amp;ldquo;meatbag&amp;rdquo;) out for a spin. I&amp;rsquo;m embracing my inner fool and waving goodbye to pretending. No more trying to sound like a smarty-pants. No more stressing about needing to be more than I am. Because honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s more crucial to know what I can handle rather than clumsily fighting against myself. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m giving up on understanding; it&amp;rsquo;s more like I&amp;rsquo;m acknowledging my boundaries. I&amp;rsquo;m done with the self-inflicted headache over my thought process (or lack thereof, most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a brainiac, and who knows, I might never be. And that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine. Life&amp;rsquo;s a blast, filled with things waiting to be explored. I enjoy watching bumblebees do their thing around flowers, and I get a kick out of observing everyone living their lives. If I&amp;rsquo;m the everyday dunce, at least I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to be a kind one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Privacy Has Become Increasingly Important.</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/how-privacy-has-become-increasingly-important/how-privacy-has-become-increasingly-important/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 08:55:27 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/how-privacy-has-become-increasingly-important/how-privacy-has-become-increasingly-important/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-privacy-has-become-increasingly-important&#34;&gt;How Privacy Has Become Increasingly Important&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, privacy has emerged as a paramount concern for individuals and organizations alike. With the rapid advancement of technology and the proliferation of online platforms, the need to safeguard personal information and maintain data confidentiality has become crucial. In this article, we will explore the significance of privacy in today&amp;rsquo;s world and delve into the various reasons why it has become increasingly important. By understanding the implications of privacy breaches and adopting proactive measures, individuals and businesses can navigate the digital landscape while protecting their sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-privacy&#34;&gt;The Evolution of Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-early-days-of-the-internet&#34;&gt;The Early Days of the Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the internet, privacy concerns were relatively minimal. The internet was a nascent technology, and the concept of personal data being stored and shared online was not yet widespread. Individuals would navigate the online realm with a sense of anonymity, and there was a general lack of awareness regarding the potential risks associated with sharing personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rise-of-social-media-and-online-services&#34;&gt;The Rise of Social Media and Online Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the internet evolved, social media platforms and online services gained prominence. People began willingly sharing personal details, such as their locations, interests, and daily activities, on these platforms. Initially, the benefits of social connectivity and convenient online services outweighed the privacy concerns for many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privacy-breaches-and-data-exploitation&#34;&gt;Privacy Breaches and Data Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the advent of privacy breaches and data exploitation incidents shed light on the vulnerability of personal information in the digital realm. High-profile cases involving the unauthorized access and misuse of user data by companies sparked public outrage and led to a shift in attitudes towards privacy. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, for instance, exposed how personal data could be weaponized for targeted advertising and manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-privacy&#34;&gt;The Importance of Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;safeguarding-personal-information&#34;&gt;Safeguarding Personal Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy plays a pivotal role in safeguarding personal information. With the increasing reliance on online platforms for various activities, including communication, banking, and shopping, individuals must ensure that their sensitive data remains confidential. By maintaining privacy, individuals can protect themselves from identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preserving-autonomy-and-freedom&#34;&gt;Preserving Autonomy and Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is intricately linked to personal autonomy and freedom. When individuals have control over their personal information, they can make informed choices about its usage and dissemination. Privacy empowers individuals to express their opinions, explore diverse ideas, and engage in activities without the fear of surveillance or judgment. It fosters an environment that values personal autonomy and encourages the free exchange of thoughts and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-trust-and-reputation&#34;&gt;Building Trust and Reputation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is essential for establishing trust between individuals, businesses, and institutions. When organizations prioritize data protection and privacy, they demonstrate their commitment to ethical practices and respect for their customers&amp;rsquo; rights. Trustworthy businesses that prioritize privacy tend to attract more customers, as individuals feel confident in sharing their information and engaging with their products or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-implications-of-ignoring-privacy&#34;&gt;The Implications of Ignoring Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-of-content&#34;&gt;Table of content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme supports displaying table of content (ToC) in blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parameters&#34;&gt;Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can manage a ToC with two parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; parameter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; parameter has higher priority than the global &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-table-of-content-on-all-posts&#34;&gt;Enable table of content on all posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable ToC on all posts (globally) set parameter &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;toc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To disable ToC globally, simply ignore the &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; parameter or set it to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-table-of-content-on-certain-posts&#34;&gt;Enable table of content on certain posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable ToC on certain posts set parameter &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in post settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```yaml
---
title: How to enable table of content
date: 2023-05-02
toc: true
---
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-table-of-content-on-certain-posts&#34;&gt;Disable table of content on certain posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable ToC on certain posts, you have to follow two steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice: &lt;code&gt;.Params.toc&lt;/code&gt; in the post will override &lt;code&gt;.Site.Params.toc&lt;/code&gt;. After these steps, parameter &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt;  in the post will be &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set parameter &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;toc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;toc = false&lt;/code&gt; to the front matter of the post for which you wish to disable ToC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;How to enable table of content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ld&#34;&gt;2023-05-02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;toc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-table-of-content&#34;&gt;Open table of content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, ToC is closed. To open it by default, set parameter &lt;code&gt;tocOpen&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;tocOpen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or simply add the &lt;code&gt;tocOpen&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the front matter of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;How to enable table of content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ld&#34;&gt;2023-05-02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;tocOpen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Math Typesetting - use Mathematical notation in blog posts</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/math-typesetting/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/math-typesetting/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome/blob/main/layouts/partials/helpers/katex.html&#34;&gt;third party JavaScript libraries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we will be using &lt;a href=&#34;https://katex.org/&#34;&gt;KaTeX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable KaTeX globally, set the parameter &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in a project&amp;rsquo;s
configuration file as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;math&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable KaTeX on a per page basis, include the parameter &lt;code&gt;math: true&lt;/code&gt; in
Front Matter of Markdown content file as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
math: true
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The online reference of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://katex.org/docs/supported.html&#34;&gt;Supported TeX Functions&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inline math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an inline polynomial: $5x^2 + 2y -7$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>How to plan a productive day.</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/how-to-plan-a-productive-day/how-to-plan-a-productive-day/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 21:46:00 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/how-to-plan-a-productive-day/how-to-plan-a-productive-day/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-plan-a-productive-day&#34;&gt;How to Plan a Productive Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a productive day is all about setting yourself up for success. With a bit of planning and organization, you can make the most of your time and accomplish your goals. Here are some tips to help you plan a productive day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-with-a-to-do-list&#34;&gt;Start with a To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start your day, make a list of the tasks you need to complete. This will help you stay focused and ensure that you don&amp;rsquo;t forget anything important. Prioritize your tasks based on their urgency and importance, and try to tackle the most difficult or time-consuming ones first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-up-your-day&#34;&gt;Break Up Your Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to work for hours on end without taking breaks can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Instead, break up your day into smaller, manageable chunks. Work for a set amount of time, and then take a short break to stretch, move around, or do something enjoyable. This will help you stay energized and focused throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minimize-distractions&#34;&gt;Minimize Distractions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distractions can quickly derail your productivity and make it difficult to stay on task. To minimize distractions, turn off your phone notifications and email alerts, and close any unnecessary tabs on your computer. If possible, work in a quiet space where you won&amp;rsquo;t be interrupted by noise or other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-care-of-yourself&#34;&gt;Take Care of Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of your physical and mental health is crucial for maintaining productivity. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated throughout the day. Take breaks to stretch or do some light exercise, and prioritize activities that help you relax and unwind, like reading or meditating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-your-progress&#34;&gt;Review Your Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, take a few minutes to review your progress and reflect on what went well and what could be improved. Use this information to adjust your plan for the next day, and celebrate the small wins along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these tips in mind, you&amp;rsquo;ll be well on your way to planning a productive day that helps you accomplish your goals and feel more fulfilled in your work and personal life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markdown Syntax Guide</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/markdown-syntax/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/markdown-syntax/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headings&#34;&gt;Headings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;—&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h6&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the highest section level while &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h6&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;h1&#34;&gt;H1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;h2&#34;&gt;H2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;h3&#34;&gt;H3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;h4&#34;&gt;H4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;h5&#34;&gt;H5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;h6&#34;&gt;H6&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;Paragraph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo. Aque venitatiusda cum, voluptionse latur sitiae dolessi aut parist aut dollo enim qui voluptate ma dolestendit peritin re plis aut quas inctum laceat est volestemque commosa as cus endigna tectur, offic to cor sequas etum rerum idem sintibus eiur?

&lt;p&gt;Itatur? Quiatae cullecum rem ent aut odis in re eossequodi nonsequ idebis ne sapicia is sinveli squiatum, core et que aut hariosam ex eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;image&#34;&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the following syntax to include an image. Path of the image should be relative to the &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;![&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;Landscape&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;1.jpg&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://yuricunha.com/posts/markdown-syntax/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Landscape&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also include image from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;![&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x400/?tech&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x400/?tech&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockquotes&#34;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a &lt;code&gt;footer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cite&lt;/code&gt; element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockquote-without-attribution&#34;&gt;Blockquote without attribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Markdown syntax within a blockquote, like &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockquote-with-attribution&#34;&gt;Blockquote with attribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.&lt;br&gt;
— &lt;cite&gt;Rob Pike&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tables&#34;&gt;Tables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables aren&amp;rsquo;t part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports them out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bob | 27
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice | 23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-within-tables&#34;&gt;Markdown within tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Italics&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Bold&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Code&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;roadmap-to-becoming-a-junior-front-end-developer&#34;&gt;Roadmap to Becoming a Junior Front-End Developer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a front-end developer requires a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a lot of practice. Front-end developers design and build user interfaces for websites and applications, and must have strong attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and an eye for good design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a roadmap to help you on your journey to becoming a junior front-end developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-learn-html-and-css&#34;&gt;Step 1: Learn HTML and CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the building blocks of the web. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, while CSS provides the styling and layout.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emoji Support</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/emoji-support/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/emoji-support/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;emojify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function can be called directly in templates or &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/#inline-shortcodes&#34;&gt;Inline Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable emoji globally, set &lt;code&gt;enableEmoji&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in your site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt;. You can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:see_no_evil:&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#x1f648; &lt;code&gt;:hear_no_evil:&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#x1f649; &lt;code&gt;:speak_no_evil:&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#x1f64a;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f; Hugo! 😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&#34;&gt;Emoji cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N.B.&lt;/strong&gt; The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34; data-lang=&#34;css&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;emoji&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Emoji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Segoe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Emoji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;NotoColorEmoji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Segoe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Emoji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;EmojiSymbols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the SQL Server Database?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-sql-server-database&#34;&gt;What is the SQL Server Database?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SQL Server Database is a relational database management system produced by Microsoft. It is used to store and manage large amounts of data, including structured and unstructured data. SQL Server offers a wide range of features to ensure the security, availability, and integrity of stored data, as well as to ensure system performance and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several versions of SQL Server available, including SQL Server Express, SQL Server Standard, and SQL Server Enterprise. Each of these versions offers a different set of features and is suitable for different types of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work with SQL Server, it is necessary to know the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the standard language for working with relational databases and is used to create, query, and modify the data stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-structured-query-language-famous-sql&#34;&gt;What is the Structured Query Language (famous SQL)?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases. It is the standard language for working with relational databases and is used to create, query, and modify the data stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL is a declarative language, which means that it is used to describe what needs to be done, rather than specifying how it should be done. This allows the database management system (DBMS) to optimize the execution of SQL queries and ensure efficient use of system resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL is used to perform a wide range of tasks, including creating and modifying tables and indices, inserting and updating data, and retrieving data from the database. It is also used to define the structure and relationships of the data within the database, as well as to set permissions and controls for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL is a powerful and versatile language that is widely used in a variety of industries, including business, finance, healthcare, and government. It is an essential tool for database administrators and developers, and is also used by data analysts and data scientists to extract, transform, and load data for analysis and reporting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several dialects of SQL, including MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, each with its own unique features and syntax. However, the core concepts and principles of SQL are the same across all dialects, making it a language that is easy to learn and widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;examples-of-sql-queries&#34;&gt;Examples of SQL Queries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of SQL queries that can be run on the SQL Server Database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;select-query&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select Query&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following query selects all fields from the &amp;ldquo;Customers&amp;rdquo; table where the &amp;ldquo;City&amp;rdquo; field is equal to &amp;ldquo;São Paulo&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;São Paulo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;insert-data&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insert Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following query inserts a new record into the &amp;ldquo;Customers&amp;rdquo; table:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;VALUES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;João da Silva&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Rua das Flores, 123&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;São Paulo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following query updates the &amp;ldquo;Address&amp;rdquo; field of the record with ID 1 in the &amp;ldquo;Customers&amp;rdquo; table:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Rua das Oliveiras, 456&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To add the new customer record, you can use the following SQL query:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;VALUES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;John Smith&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;123 Main Street&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;New York&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This query will insert a new record into the &amp;ldquo;Customers&amp;rdquo; table with the specified name, address, and city.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-example&#34;&gt;Second example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the database administrator for a product inventory database. You need to update the quantity of a product with the ID &amp;ldquo;12345&amp;rdquo; to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution-1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are the database administrator for a product inventory database. You need to update the quantity of a product with the ID &amp;ldquo;12345&amp;rdquo; to 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;12345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This query will update the &amp;ldquo;Quantity&amp;rdquo; field of the product with the ID &amp;ldquo;12345&amp;rdquo; to the value 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;complex-example&#34;&gt;Complex example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a complex example and solution involving the SQL Server Database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the database administrator for a large online retailer. The company has a database with several tables storing information about customers, orders, and products. The database is used to track customer information, process orders, and generate reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the company&amp;rsquo;s sales managers has requested a report showing the total sales and number of orders for each customer, broken down by product category. The report should show the data for the past year, and should be sorted by total sales in descending order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution-2&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate the requested report, you can use the following SQL query:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Customer&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SUM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Total Sales&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Number of Orders&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Product Category&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Orders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CustomerID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ProductID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;2022-01-01&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;2022-12-31&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Total Sales&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;DESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This query will select the customer name, total sales, number of orders, and product category for all orders placed within the specified date range. It will then group the results by customer name and product category, and will sort the results by total sales in descending order. The resulting report will show the total sales and number of orders for each customer, broken down by product category.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the examples have helped you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 18:26:30 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/tools-and-products-that-i-use-everyday/tools-and-products-that-i-use-everyday/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tools come and go. But some things just stick. In the list below I grouped all the tools that I use for work and at home. If you have questions about anything on this list, feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@yuricunha.com&#34;&gt;message me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;productivity&#34;&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alfredapp.com/&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight on steroids. I use Alfred at least 20 times per day to open apps, access my clipboard, and start small workflows (e.g refresh my Wi-Fi). I happily paid for the Powerpack and recommend Alfred to everyone who works on a mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dynalist.io/&#34;&gt;Dynalist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynalist lets you outline everything that crosses your mind. Think bullet-points where you can go as deep as you want and any bullet-point can be seen as an individual page. I use it as my note-taking app, occasional journal and for writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripmode.ch/&#34;&gt;Tripmode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always afraid to use too much data when I worked on my hotspot. Not anymore. With Tripmode I can easily manage which apps have internet access and see how much I used in one session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rescuetime.com/&#34;&gt;Rescuetime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescuetime runs in the background on my Mac and Android and tracks my screen time. I&amp;rsquo;m often too afraid to look into the statistics. The calendar integration is great for a quick overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lastpass.com/&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LastPass is the biggest time saver. I use it both personally and at work to manage passwords, and store confidential data. (e.g social identification number). I would be completely lost without this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sipapp.io/&#34;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIP is a beautiful color picker. I only use the colour picker feature, but the rest of the app is pretty nice too. My custom shortcut is &lt;code&gt;⌥ + SHIFT + -&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.framer.com/&#34;&gt;Framer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framer lets you design and code in one project. This means that prototypes can use real data, be interactive and much more detailed. I find this extremely appealing and try to use Framer whenever I can. The only drawback at the moment is the missing web version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.figma.com/&#34;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figma is the standard for collaborative design. It&amp;rsquo;s intuitive to use, has a plugin ecosystem and the performance is unmatched. I use it when I need to work with other designers or developers in one file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html&#34;&gt;Adobe Creative Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share a monthly Adobe Cloud subscription with my girlfriend. The only apps I use are Lightroom, Photoshop and Illustrator. I think that most of the Adobe apps are clunky, too powerful and I tend to get frustrated working with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canva.com/&#34;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canva is a simple but feature-rich web app for quick designs. There is a massive template library for every format you can think about. This makes it possible to quickly design something that just looks good. I use Canva for social media posts, print design and random things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VS code became very popular when I started to code at the end of 2018. And that for a reason. The app is quick as a flash and offers many extensions by the community. I do all my coding in VS Code and have nothing to complain about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no expert when it comes to hosting and back-end topics. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love Netlify. It just works and helps me to get back into what I feel comfortable with. I&amp;rsquo;m on the free tier and use Netlify for hosting my static projects. I also have a nice pair of socks by Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.namecheap.com/&#34;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first domain with Namecheap and never made the switch. There is probably a better domain registrar out there, but I never took the courage to switch. If you think I need to make the jump, please write to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my code lives on GitHub. You can see the code for this website &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wirtzdan/new-website&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on, feel free to write to me. I would be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iterm2.com/&#34;&gt;iTerm 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use iTerm as my terminal client in combination with zsh. I honestly have no clue why I need this other than that I have nice themes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://imageoptim.com/mac&#34;&gt;ImageOptim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ImageOptim is a hidden gem. The small app can easily bulk compress 100 images at once and often reduce file-size by half. I use it in combination with Preview to cut, scale and compress all of my images for web usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech&#34;&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack&#34;&gt;Peak Design Everyday Backpack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak Design is one of the brands which I would jump into the fire with. I hesitated at first to buy the backpack, but it was worth every penny. I&amp;rsquo;m running around with this backpack every day and use it for work, travel, groceries, and photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro&#34;&gt;MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My on-the-go workstation and backpack companion. I spend the majority of my time with this device and love the convenience it gives me. Pricy, but worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t10/&#34;&gt;Fujifilm X-T10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a special connection to this camera since I bought it at the beginning of university. It&amp;rsquo;s small, clicky and always impresses me with the image quality. I constantly switch between two prime lenses (23mm F2 &amp;amp; 50mm F2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/de/shop/product/MLA02Z/A/magic-mouse-2-silber&#34;&gt;Magic Mouse 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Magic Mouse 2 that I snatched on eBay for 30€. Works like a charm on any surface. The only complain that I have is that it needs batteries. I often forget to pack an extra pack when I&amp;rsquo;m on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01N99IGMQ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2XJA82MXCVRRC&amp;amp;keywords=mobiler&amp;#43;laptop&amp;#43;st%C3%A4nder&amp;amp;qid=1573384409&amp;amp;sprefix=mobile&amp;#43;laptop%2Caps%2C200&amp;amp;sr=8-5&#34;&gt;Ergonomic Laptop Stand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the smallest and most lightweight laptop stand that I found. Always attached to the side of my backpack and fast to set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k380&#34;&gt;Logitech K380&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This keyboard &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wirtzdan/status/1193482720615243776?s=19&#34;&gt;fits perfectly&lt;/a&gt; into the top department of my backpack. That alone is very satisfying. In combination with my laptop-stand, mouse and backpack I have a very flexible workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50 days of meditation.</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/waking-up-app/waking-up-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 16:20:27 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/waking-up-app/waking-up-app/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two months ago my mind wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the best shape. My thoughts were always drifting in different directions. When I woke up once, I immediately started to think about my daily agenda and how I should handle an important call at work. Even though I even prepared breakfast or brushed my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind felt a little bit like a bar fight in a western movie. A scene of chaos, with things flying around in all directions. Something had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I made good experience with meditation. While I was studying I was introduced to meditation by listening to the Tim Ferris podcast. I hesitated at first. Meditation always appeared to me as something for monks, spiritual people and hippies. But when I started with practice it helped me to calm down from the hectic life a university student. When I had the feeling that I attained more calmness, I somehow stopped to meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I always wanted to try was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wakingup.com&#34;&gt;Waking Up&lt;/a&gt; app by Sam Harris. Sam Harris is a philosopher, neuroscientist and host of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://samharris.org/podcast/&#34;&gt;Making Sense&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I always admired his way of speaking. He presents often complex topics in simple, yet powerful clarity. And someone who is able to speak clearly also thinks clearly. One can&amp;rsquo;t go without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris also has a lot of experience in speaking and writing, but he is also meditating for more than 30 years. That sparked my interest to take a look into his app and try out the introduction course for 50 days. In this article, I sum up some of my learnings and observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-ten-minutes-can-go-a-long-way&#34;&gt;1. Ten minutes can go a long way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the introduction course, I always meditated for roughly ten minutes. Sometimes even that felt long and daunting. But most of the time, the sessions end quicker than I expected.
For me, that timeframe, felt exactly right, because you can always squeeze in ten minutes. Even if you are busy with work, tired of sport or travelling for the whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-meditating-with-the-morning-sun&#34;&gt;2. Meditating with the morning sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditating in the morning was the key for me to &lt;strong&gt;stay consistent with the practice&lt;/strong&gt;. Not because the morning has a better effect per see. But I have the most control over how I spend my mornings and I can&amp;rsquo;t say this about evenings. Sometimes I stay home and go to bed earlier, but on another day I could go out with friends and come back later in the night. Meditating in the mornings helped me to stick to daily habit and when I forget it in the morning, I was still able to do it throughout the day or in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-you-dont-need-a-silent-spot-to-meditate&#34;&gt;3. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a silent spot to meditate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meditations in the introduction course where guided meditation. Sam Harris provided clear instructions and often explained the reason behind the practice. But sometimes he spoke a lot and that made it harder for me to relax and meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the lessons, he addressed this, because many students give him that feedback. He explains that meditation isn&amp;rsquo;t something you should only do when you are in a quiet environment. Meditation is about being mindful and in the best case this is a state of living. Rather than a ten minutes window once a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made total sense for me and I started to &lt;strong&gt;meditate in more lifelike environments&lt;/strong&gt;. Sometimes the dishwasher was going, the window was open. The challenge of staying undistracted in loud environments was a great challenge to practice mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-who-is-the-thinker&#34;&gt;4. Who is the Thinker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever asked yourself if you can pick your next thought? Maybe you think this is a stupid question, but observe your mind for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are like me, thoughts often just appear.&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to how bubbles appear on the lake, thoughts appear in conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s also why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to sit still and think about nothing for five minutes. It sounds simple, but in practice it&amp;rsquo;s impossible. With effort you can keep your mind focused on the breath for 30 seconds, but once your attention slips your mind goes on a free ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, thoughts will just appear in conscious. Maybe because you heard a familiar sound, or remembered to do something, but sometimes also completely randomly. Even if you tell yourself you are the thinker in your head, the reality tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-quality-of-mind&#34;&gt;5. Quality of mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profound insight for me was that the quality of my mind is at the base of every experience I have and the contribution I make to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On days where I had a good meditation session, I felt more aware, productive and fulfilled. This was most visible at work, where I often was forced to listen carefully to clients and where everything has to make sense that I verbalise. Before meditating with Waking up, I sometimes zoned out of conversations, got distracted and felt guilty afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this still happens. &lt;strong&gt;Getting distracted is the natural state of the mind.&lt;/strong&gt; But now that I meditate frequently, it happens less and for me, this improved what Sam Harris often calls the quality of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, my mind was all over the place. But now I&amp;rsquo;m feeling much more mindful with my thoughts and experiences throughout the day. Meditating for the last 50 days showed me what difference it can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I want to continue on the journey and go regularly to my mental fitness gym. Which for me means to sit down at the couch, drink a tea and do nothing for ten minutes per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: If you want to give the Waking up a try, here is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://share.wakingup.com/327932&#34;&gt;invitation link&lt;/a&gt; which will unlock the app for you for a month. I don&amp;rsquo;t get anything for it, but as it was helpful for me, so can it be for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coisas que eu gostaria que tivessem me dito quando entrei na faculdade de TI.</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/coisas-que-eu-gostaria-que-tivessem-me-dito-quando-entrei-na-faculdade-de-ti/coisas-que-eu-gostaria-que-tivessem-me-dito-quando-entrei-na-faculdade-de-ti/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/coisas-que-eu-gostaria-que-tivessem-me-dito-quando-entrei-na-faculdade-de-ti/coisas-que-eu-gostaria-que-tivessem-me-dito-quando-entrei-na-faculdade-de-ti/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Semestre começando na faculdade e vários calouros com dúvidas no grupo do Telegram. Isso lembrou-me das minhas próprias dúvidas quando comecei a minha primeira graduação e das coisas que gostaria de saber naquela época.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - Inglês&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A esmagadora maioria das documentações está em inglês e um site de tradução nem sempre irá te ajudar, em alguns casos ele irá traduzir termos técnicos que não deveriam ser traduzidos ou possuem outro significado fora do contexto de informática.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ler em inglês: Ter uma boa leitura em inglês já é 50% do necessário.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escrever em inglês: Vai te ajudar muito a tirar dúvidas em fóruns especializados (&lt;em&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;slack&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;mailing lists&lt;/em&gt;) e entrar em contato com suporte de outras empresas (&lt;em&gt;Red Hat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt; e etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversação: Com certeza te abrirá mais portas de emprego, no Brasil, no exterior ou em &lt;em&gt;Home Office&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Se ainda estiver cético, nesse pequeno trecho que leu, foram 9 palavras em inglês.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - TI é tão vasto quanto medicina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redes, middleware, analise de requisitos, DBA, AD, Ops, QA, Linux, Front end, back end, Java, Ruby, governança &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Não se prenda apenas aos mais famosos, suporte e desenvolvimento (não há nenhum problema com esses dois, claro), experimente um pouco de tudo, identifique-se com algum e se especialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - TI não é uma ciência exata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A afirmação parece absurda, mas quem ficou horas tentando resolver algum problema sem nenhum - aparente - erro lógico, sabe do que estou falando. Isso vai causar frustração em alguns casos, mas o ponto principal aqui é saber decidir quando descobrir a causa do problema é mais importante do que de fato resolvê-lo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 - Use o tutorial, mas leia a documentação&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;como instalar o git&amp;rsquo; : 3.020.00 resultados no google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;CRUD no php&amp;rsquo; : 7.530.000 resultados no google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Configurar NGINX&amp;rsquo; : 355.000 resultados no google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esses tutoriais (how to) são úteis, mas entender para que serve e como funciona é essencial quando precisar consertar algo ou fazer uma melhoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 - Não tenha medo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quando eu comecei em TI, tinha medo de instalar o Linux e não saber configurar ou resolver um problema. Tinha medo de tentar fazer algo e errar. É clichê, largamente difundido e estudado, papo de coach, eu sei, mas errar é essencial para o aprendizado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoje quando instalo ou configuro um sistema, quando crio uma pipeline, um script ou executo qualquer outra coisa e funciona na primeira tentativa, fico com uma pulga atrás da orelha achando que fiz algo errado e o problema só vai aparecer no futuro (e isso é bom pois me faz revisar tudo que fiz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O medo sempre vai aparecer diante do novo, do inesperado e nesses momento eu penso em uma frase que escutei de um colega de trabalho alguns anos atrás:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Não sei fazer, mas se tiver tempo, posso aprender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBS: Se estiver fazendo algo com grande possibilidade de erro, dê preferência ao ambiente de desenvolvimento, ok?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 - TI é uma ferramenta, use-a.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passe uma semana criando um código para automatizar uma tarefa, mas não gaste 2 dias fazendo essa mesma tarefa manualmente. O tempo gasto a mais é facilmente compensado pelo que se aprendeu e pela possibilidade de executar essa mesma tarefa no futuro.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conselhos que eu gostaria de ter ouvido quando comecei na tecnologia.</title>
      <link>https://yuricunha.com/posts/conselhos-que-eu-gostaria-de-ter-ouvido-quando-comecei-na-tecnologia/conselhos-que-eu-gostaria-de-ter-ouvido-quando-comecei-na-tecnologia/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yuricunha.com/posts/conselhos-que-eu-gostaria-de-ter-ouvido-quando-comecei-na-tecnologia/conselhos-que-eu-gostaria-de-ter-ouvido-quando-comecei-na-tecnologia/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 — A prática leva à perfeição.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Não posso detalhar mais do que isso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 — Não fique desapontado se vir códigos, sites e aplicativos que parecem bem complicados.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Acredite, aqueles que elaboraram aplicativos como Instagram, WhatsApp ou Facebook praticaram décadas, talvez décadas, para elaborar esses aplicativos.&lt;br /&gt;
Você precisa de tempo. A diferença entre um mestre e um iniciante é o tempo. Afinal, o tempo traz a prática, e a experiência.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 — Você precisa de uma boa equipe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Uma boa equipe irá inspirá-lo e empurrá-lo para além dos seus limites. Claro que, uma boa equipe não se limita a trabalho, mas, amigos, colegas de faculdade, classe, e por ai vai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 — Escreva códigos claros e legíveis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Escrever códigos legíveis o ajudará a ler seus próprios códigos depois de um certo tempo e permitirá que outros programadores saibam o que você fez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 — A sintaxe deve ser escrita com o máximo de concentração.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Porque, um pequeno erro de sintaxe pode gerar muitos problemas, como esquecer um ponto e vírgula ou escrever &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;fuction()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; em vez de &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;function()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — e, às vezes isso dói no coração.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 — Escreva nomes simples e com significado.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Isso até parece vago, mas, já pensou se uma variável ou função tem um nome nada a ver com nada?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;var textoMuitoLouco = 1 + 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agora, se eu quiser usar essa váriavel, mas ela não tem nada a ver com o valor armazenado, lascou-se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, lembre-se que existem algumas convenções que você pode usar. Eu particularmente prefiro usar o &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 — Programar não é tão complexo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Não existe um problema tão grande na programação, o que sempre existe, é um conjunto de pequenos problemas que formam esse grande problema, e, o maior problema, é que as pessoas parecem ter vergonha de pesquisar — ou perguntar nos fóruns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 — Leia Livros e e-livros (e-books).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Leia muitos livros, os livros sempre foram os melhores recursos para aprender qualquer coisa, fora que vão te ajudar muito na lógica e paciência.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 — Você não está entediado, apenas não está motivado.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Não pense que você está entediado enquanto programa. A amarga verdade é que você não está entediado, apenas não está motivado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lembro-me de quando eu ia elaborar algum site ou estruturar um banco de dados, e do nada eu parava e fica meio &amp;ldquo;meh, que chato&amp;rdquo;. Mas, eu só estava desmotivado, porém, quando eu fazia algo que nem eu mesmo imagina que conseguiria, ficava sorrindo feito um bobo, com sorriso de orelha a orelha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 — Nem sempre acredite em Youtubers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
É sério! Nem sempre acredite em Youtubers, dizendo que as 10 melhores linguagens de programação para aprender em 2022 são aquelas que eles dizem, porque às vezes, Cobol vem em primeiro lugar na lista deles, — não que seja errado, mas se for para programar na época dos dinossauros, eu tentaria inventar uma máquina do tempo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 — Não se preocupe com o tempo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Não se preocupe com o tempo para aprender a programar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geralmente leva um tempo para dominar uma linguagem. Apenas se certifique de que você não está se desviando.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tudo que é bom precisa de tempo, não se apresse em fazer coisas da noite para o dia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 — Escolha uma linguagem ou o conjunto dela.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Muitas pessoas têm a mania de começar a aprender Python, largar quando começou a ver às variáveis e já partir para HTML misturado com Ruby on Rails, procurando PHP… Calma lá, Einstein.&lt;br /&gt;
Primeiro, tente achar qual área da programação quer seguir, seja dbA, front-end ou UI/UX. E, quando decidir, você pode achar vários &lt;a href=&#34;https://roadmap.sh/&#34; title=&#34;roadmaps&#34;&gt;roadmaps&lt;/a&gt; na internet, mas mesmo que prefira não seguir um &lt;a href=&#34;https://roadmap.sh/&#34; title=&#34;roadmaps&#34;&gt;roadmaps&lt;/a&gt;, veja a principal linguagem sendo usada e foque nela. E, pode ficar numa boa, porque uma linguagem vai te levar a outra que a completa (SQL 💚 Python, ops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusão:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Como disse Elon Musk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t need college to learn stuff, the value is seeing whether somebody can work hard at something.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portanto, você precisa ter um plano para melhorar suas habilidades de codificação diariamente e não parar de aprender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Após anos de experiência você se tornará um especialista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bônus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recomendarei um ótimo livro, para pessoas que decidiram começar a aprender a programar por conta própria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O conteúdo é apresentado de concisamente em etapas que gradualmente se complementam de uma forma que permite que você acompanhe sem problemas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;WHO AM I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Yuri, a dbA passionate about building resilient systems and ensuring seamless performance. My expertise spans server optimization, database management, and deploying scalable cloud solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m exploring new opportunities to apply my skills in designing efficient infrastructures and optimizing IT operations. In my previous roles, I mastered fine-tuning databases and creating reliable architectures at companies like Divinobit (now Bairon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drives me? Solving complex challenges in infrastructure, creating streamlined processes, and transforming raw data into actionable insights. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s like engineering for the digital age — crafting solutions that stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While based in Brazil, I often find inspiration in solo travel, discovering diverse landscapes, and immersing myself in new cultures. These adventures keep me refreshed and ready to tackle the next big project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s managing servers, fine-tuning databases, or scaling cloud platforms, I&amp;rsquo;m all about delivering excellence and finding harmony in technology. Let&amp;rsquo;s build something remarkable together!&lt;/p&gt;
