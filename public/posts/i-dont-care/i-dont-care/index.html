                <div class="page-content">
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve always been like this. I was a shy kid with few friends. I preferred spending time
                        alone, reading books, or playing video games.</p>
                    <p>As I got older, I realized I don&rsquo;t need to care about what others think. I don&rsquo;t have
                        to pretend to be interested in things I&rsquo;m not. I can just be myself.</p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m completely indifferent to everyone. I have a few close friends and
                        family members I deeply care about. But for the most part, I just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
                    <p>I don&rsquo;t care about what people wear or what they do with their lives. I don&rsquo;t care
                        about the latest news or gossip. I don&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s going on in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some people find my indifference off-putting, thinking I&rsquo;m rude or arrogant. But I&rsquo;m
                        not. I&rsquo;m just being honest.</p>
                    <p>I won&rsquo;t pretend to care about something I don&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t waste my time and
                        energy on things that don&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
                    <p><strong>Benefits of Indifference</strong></p>
                    <p>Indifference has freed me from the expectations of others. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about what
                        they think or want me to be. I can just be myself.</p>
                    <p>It lets me focus on what&rsquo;s important to me. I don&rsquo;t waste time and energy on what
                        doesn&rsquo;t matter. I focus on my passions and my relationships with people I care about.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s made me more resilient. I&rsquo;m not easily bothered by setbacks or disappointments.
                        I know life has ups and downs, and I don&rsquo;t let the downs get me down.</p>
                    <p><strong>Choices</strong></p>
                    <p>I sat in the park, and Sarah approached me with a weary look, like a shipwrecked sailor seeking
                        salvation. She unleashed a torrent of complaints about her life – her toxic relationship, her
                        soul-sucking job, and her endlessly problematic family.</p>
                    <p>She rambled on, spilling her guts, hoping for some kind words, a pat on the back, or a sprinkle
                        of sympathy. But as she finally took a breath, I couldn&rsquo;t sugarcoat the apathy that
                        coursed through my veins.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; I said bluntly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been moaning about this for ages.
                        Frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of hearing the same sob story. If you&rsquo;re so miserable, why
                        don&rsquo;t you just do something about it? I can&rsquo;t be bothered with your drama.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>Her eyes widened in disbelief, and her hopes shattered like glass. She had expected compassion,
                        but what she got was a harsh dose of reality.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yuri,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d at least pretend to care.
                        You&rsquo;re so heartless.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I shrugged indifferently. &ldquo;Pretending is not my style, Sarah. You&rsquo;re stuck in a
                        self-imposed mess, and my patience is wearing thin. You&rsquo;re the one who needs to decide
                        whether you want to keep wallowing in self-pity or actually do something.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Sarah left, crushed and flabbergasted, and I was left to my own thoughts. Sometimes, the truth is
                        bitter medicine, and not everyone can swallow it without choking. But in a world where I
                        didn&rsquo;t care about most things, I couldn&rsquo;t afford to sugarcoat reality, even if it
                        meant sacrificing a friendship.</p>
                    <p>After Sarah stormed off, I remained seated, unfazed by her exit. I&rsquo;d done what I believed
                        was right. Indifference had its virtues, but it also had its harsh edges.</p>
                    <p>A week later, Sarah contacted me again. She had taken some time to digest our conversation, and
                        perhaps a hint of realization had seeped in. She seemed more composed this time, her
                        expectations seemingly adjusted.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yuri,&rdquo; she began cautiously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about what you said, and it
                        stung. But I can&rsquo;t help but admit that you might be onto something. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been
                        stuck in this rut for too long.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t mince words. &ldquo;Sarah, I had to be brutally honest because you were stuck in a
                        never-ending cycle of complaints without taking action. If you&rsquo;re finally realizing that,
                        then it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>She nodded, acknowledging my point. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame you for being straightforward. I
                        guess it&rsquo;s time for me to make some changes, for real this time.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I gave her a curt nod. &ldquo;Good. Remember, I don&rsquo;t care about your complaints, but I do
                        care about you. If you&rsquo;re ready to change, I&rsquo;m here to support you.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Sarah&rsquo;s face displayed a mix of determination and resignation. She had learned the hard way
                        that complaining wasn&rsquo;t going to change her circumstances. It was up to her to make a
                        choice: remain in the same rut or take action to create a better life. My indifference had
                        served as a stark reminder that, sometimes, the most valuable advice is the one we don&rsquo;t
                        want to hear.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after my candid conversation with Sarah, another incident occurred that highlighted my
                        unique perspective on empathy. It was my cousin, Alex, who approached me this time. I could tell
                        he was trying to choose his words carefully, and I braced myself for what was to come.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yuri,&rdquo; Alex began, &ldquo;I know we&rsquo;re family, but I need to tell you
                        something. Our distant relative, Aunt Margot, passed away.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I stared at him blankly, my indifference apparent. Aunt Margot was someone I&rsquo;d never met,
                        had no connection with, and certainly didn&rsquo;t care about. She was just a distant figure in
                        the family tree, someone I had no reason to mourn.</p>
                    <p>Alex mustered a weak smile, as if trying to appeal to some hidden well of empathy within me.
                        &ldquo;I thought you should know because, well, we are related.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I shook my head, unapologetically blunt. &ldquo;Alex, I appreciate you letting me know, but I
                        have no emotional connection to Aunt Margot. We may share some distant bloodline, but that
                        doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m going to pretend to grieve for someone I never knew.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Alex&rsquo;s smile faded, replaced by an awkward silence. He had probably expected some form of
                        sympathy, even from a distant relative, but he was met with my cold and unapologetic
                        indifference.</p>
                    <p>I could sense the unease in the air as Alex realized that I wasn&rsquo;t going to play the part
                        of the grieving family member. In a world where I didn&rsquo;t care about most things or most
                        people, I couldn&rsquo;t fake emotions or empathy for someone I had no connection to.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dealing with People Who Don&rsquo;t Understand</strong></p>
                    <p>Some people find my indifference off-putting, thinking I&rsquo;m rude or arrogant. But I&rsquo;m
                        not. I&rsquo;m just being honest.</p>
                    <p>I try to be patient and understanding with those who don&rsquo;t get it. I explain I care about
                        them but not most things. I respect their opinions, even if I disagree.</p>
                    <p>If someone&rsquo;s rude or disrespectful because of my indifference, I walk away. I don&rsquo;t
                        have time for negative, judgmental people.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to Be Indifferent</strong></p>
                    <p>If you want to be more indifferent, here are some tips:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identify what you care about.</strong> Focus on what&rsquo;s truly important to you,
                            and let go of the rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to others.</strong> Everyone is different, with unique
                            goals and values.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accept that you can&rsquo;t control everything.</strong> Focus on what&rsquo;s
                            within your control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Let go of expectations.</strong> Expectations lead to disappointment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong> Stay in the present without judgment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additional tips:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t take things personally.</strong> Most people aren&rsquo;t trying to hurt
                            you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t dwell on the past.</strong> It&rsquo;s over, and you can&rsquo;t change
                            it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about the future.</strong> Focus on the present and live in the
                            now.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember, indifference doesn&rsquo;t mean apathy. You can be indifferent to some things and
                        passionate about others. It&rsquo;s challenging but worthwhile in the long run, leading to a
                        more peaceful and fulfilling life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice to Others</strong></p>
                    <p>If you struggle with indifference:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It&rsquo;s okay not to care about everything.</li>
                        <li>Focus on what matters to you.</li>
                        <li>Don&rsquo;t let others&rsquo; opinions bother you.</li>
                        <li>Be yourself, not who others want you to be.</li>
                        <li>Don&rsquo;t waste time and energy on what doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
                    </ul>
