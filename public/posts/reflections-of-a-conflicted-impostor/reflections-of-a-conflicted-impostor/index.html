                    <p>Ah&hellip; how difficult it is to admit this, but I failed. Actually, I don&rsquo;t know if
                        it&rsquo;s difficult, if I&rsquo;m afraid, or if I just lack courage, despite many people saying
                        that fear is the absence of courage, so this might be redundant.</p>
                    <p>I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around
                        18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age,
                        because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much
                        earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or
                        well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor&hellip; I
                        remember setting up LANs for acquaintances or friends to play games, and even setting up a
                        server (more like hosting in this case) at home, so people could create their own game servers,
                        websites, emails, and various programs&hellip; I did so many things that were, well, let&rsquo;s
                        say &ldquo;ahead of my time.&rdquo; Talking like this, I even seem old, but I&rsquo;m still not
                        over 25.</p>
                    <p>The issue, in itself, is that I miserably failed to become someone better or maybe even to be
                        someone.
                        I don&rsquo;t know exactly how I failed, much less where I failed professionally, because,
                        seriously, I have two degrees, over 90 courses (which I paid for), including at Harvard, Cisco,
                        and even Microsoft certifications, but still, professionally, I feel that I failed and continue
                        to fail, even going through trial and error. And when it comes to being a person, on a personal
                        level, I also failed, I don&rsquo;t know how and I don&rsquo;t know where, but I miserably
                        failed.</p>
                    <p>I lost one of my three friends, I currently check my phone about 3-4 times a day, and totaling
                        that time, I don&rsquo;t exceed about one to two hours a day on my phone (excluding when
                        I&rsquo;m out or traveling, in which case screen time usually exceeds eight hours since I watch
                        anime). And I can&rsquo;t feel good about myself today, I can&rsquo;t have a romantic
                        relationship with any girl, not because I&rsquo;m not attracted to any, but because I simply
                        don&rsquo;t have the desire to talk to someone in that sense. I can&rsquo;t simply like most of
                        my family, mainly due to their attitudes, which I don&rsquo;t agree with. Besides, I consider
                        family to be people who are with me, who share moments with me, or who simply create bonds, not
                        people who share part of my DNA.</p>
                    <p>Maybe my solitude and loneliness have brought me this feeling? I doubt it.
                        My solitude and loneliness are things I chose and am happy with in most cases, and my
                        indifference to things that don&rsquo;t affect me is also something I feel good about. Actually,
                        these or this is the only point where I feel good and accomplished.</p>
                    <p>Honestly, this seems like an endless confusion. A crazy paradigm or paradox.
                        My professional failure, in which I dedicate and have dedicated a lot, building a name in the
                        technology field, participating in various open and even some closed projects. Building a GitHub
                        portfolio that has surpassed six thousand followers. My personal failure, even though I&rsquo;ve
                        understood that I enjoy my solitude, loneliness, and indifference to most problems.
                        However&hellip; where are these failures? Where exactly did I go wrong? Where can&rsquo;t I
                        recognize the error, or why do I believe there is a failure? What kind of mental confusion is
                        this?</p>
                    <p>Ah, my psychologist said that I suffer from impostor syndrome: I think I&rsquo;m bad at
                        everything, that I don&rsquo;t do anything well or good, and that I failed miserably at
                        everything, but actually, I&rsquo;m fine and doing well, but I deceive and lie to myself saying
                        the opposite. But honestly? I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t see or understand that.</p>
                    <p>Maybe my chronic depression is causing this? Even if it&rsquo;s somewhat stable? Or is it because
                        I grew up hearing from my biological parents that I was a shame and should have died? Even
                        hearing from my adoptive parents that I was a pride and the best they could have?</p>
                    <p>Changing the subject a bit but still within it, sometimes I cry at night and don&rsquo;t even
                        seem like the same person during the day or in front of others.
                        When I&rsquo;m out with my headphones on, listening to a song I really like, I dance alone and
                        even sway if I don&rsquo;t dance. I smile when I see something I find cool or a person who has
                        an enjoyable conversation, and look, even people who don&rsquo;t agree with me but know how to
                        have a debate make me smile because we are human beings with different cultures, ideas, or
                        views, but who can still have a conversation with debate without attacking the other. I also
                        laugh, even chuckle, when I see something funny. And all this on the street, but most of the
                        time, my mind is thinking about how I managed to fail in every aspect of my life and how
                        I&rsquo;m a despicable person, while at the same time thinking I&rsquo;m an awesome guy, and
                        hearing from others how intelligent I am.</p>
                    <p>In the end, am I a flawed, confused, silly, good, intelligent guy, or a bit of everything?
                        Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
